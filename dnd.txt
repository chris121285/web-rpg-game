Preface
 O
 nce upon a time, long, long ago, in a
 realmcalledtheMidwesternUnitedStates—
 specifically the states of Minnesota and
 Wisconsin—a group of friends gathered to
gether to forever alter the history of gam
ing.
 It wasn’ttheirintenttodoso. Theyweretiredofmerely
 reading tales about worlds of magic, monsters, and ad
venture. Theywantedtoplayinthoseworlds,ratherthan
 observe them. That they went on to invent Dungeons &
 Dragons, and thereby ignite a revolution in gaming that
 continues to this day, speaks to two things.
 First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in figuring
 out that games were the perfect way to explore worlds
 that could not otherwise exist. Almost every modern
 game, whether played on a digital device or a tabletop,
 owes some debt to D&D.
 Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the
 gametheycreated. Dungeons&Dragonssparkedathriv
ing global phenomenon. It is the first roleplaying game,
 and it remains one of the best of its breed. To play D&D,
 and to play it well, you don’t need to read all the rules,
 memorize every detail of the game, or master the fine art
 of rolling funny looking dice. None of those things have
 any bearing on what’s best about the game.
 What you need are two things, the first being friends
 with whomyoucanshare the game. Playing games with
 yourfriendsisalotoffun, butD&Ddoessomethingmore
 than entertain.
 Playing D&D is an exercise in collaborative creation.
 You and your friends create epic stories filled with ten
sion and memorabledrama. Youcreatesilly in-jokes that
 makeyoulaugh years later. The dice will be cruel to you,
 butyouwillsoldieron. Yourcollectivecreativitywillbuild
 stories that youwilltell againandagain, rangingfromthe
 utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.
 If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t
 worry. There’s a special alchemy that takes place around
 a D&Dtable that nothing else can match. Play the game
 with someone enough, and the two of you are likely to
 end up friends. It’s a cool side effect of the game. Your
 next gaming group is as close as the nearest game store,
 online forum, or gaming convention.
 The second thing you need is a lively imagination or,
 more importantly, the willingness to use whatever imag
ination you have. You don’t need to be a master story
teller or a brilliant artist. You just need toaspiretocreate,
 to have the courage of someone who is willing to build
 something and share it with others. Luckily, just as D&D
 can strengthen your friendships, it can help build in you
 the confidence to create and share. D&D is a game that
 teaches you to look for the clever solution, share the sud
denideathatcanovercomeaproblem,andpushyourself
 to imaginewhatcouldbe,ratherthansimplyacceptwhat
 is.
 The first characters and adventures you create will
 probably be a collection of cliches. That’s true of every
one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on
 down. Accept this reality and move on to create the sec
ond character or adventure, which will be better, and
 then the third, which will be better still. Repeat that
 over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to cre
ate anything, from a character’s background story to an
 epic world of fantasy adventure.
 Once you have that skill, it’s yours forever. Countless
 writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin
nings to a fewpagesofD&Dnotes,ahandfulofdice, and
 a kitchen table.
 Above all else, D&D is yours. The friendships you
 make around the table will be unique to you. The ad
ventures you embark on, the characters you create, the
 memories you make—these will be yours. D&D is your
 personal corner of the universe, a place where you have
 free reign to do as you wish.
 Goforth now. Readtherulesofthegameandthestory
 of its worlds, but always remember that you are the one
 who brings them to life. They are nothing without the
 spark of life that you give them.

Introduction
 T
 he Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game
 is about storytelling in worlds of swords and
 sorcery. It shares elements with childhood
 games of make-believe. Like those games,
 D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about
 picturing the towering castle beneath the
 stormynightskyandimagininghowafantasyadventurer
 might react to the challenges that scene presents.
 Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the craggy
 peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Cas
tle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone
 keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like aban
doned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes,
 disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge
 spansthechasm, leadingtoanarchedentrancetothecastle
 courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind,
 their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop
 the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hol
low sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis,
 green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this,
 the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm
 light spilling into the courtyard.
 Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I
 have a feeling they’re not just statues.
 Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? I
 want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is
 it going to collapse under our weight?
 Unlike a gameofmake-believe, D&Dgivesstructureto
 the stories, a wayofdeterminingtheconsequencesofthe
 adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether
 their attacks hit or miss orwhethertheiradventurerscan
 scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical light
ningbolt, orpulloffsomeotherdangeroustask. Anything
 is possible, but the dicemakesomeoutcomesmoreprob
able than others.
 Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re
 looking at the gargoyles?
 Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures
 and not decorations?
 DM: Make anIntelligence check.
 Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
 DM: Sure!
 Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
 DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is
 checking out the drawbridge?
 In the Dungeons&Dragonsgame,eachplayercreates
 anadventurer(alsocalledacharacter)andteamsupwith
 other adventurers (played by friends). Working together,
 the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a
 haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava
f
 illed cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adven
turers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, bat
tle fantastic monsters, anddiscoverfabulousmagicitems
 and other treasure.
 One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon
 Master(DM),thegame’sleadstorytellerandreferee. The
 DMcreates adventures for the characters, who navigate
 its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM
 might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the
 players decide what they want their adventurers to do.
 Will they walk a cross the dangerously weathered draw
 bridge? Tie them selves together with rope to minimize
 the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives
 way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
 Then the DM determines the results of the adventur
ers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because
 the DMcanimprovise to react to anything the players at
tempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can
 be exciting and unexpected.
 The game has no real end; when one story or quest
 wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing
 storycalledacampaign. Manypeoplewhoplaythegame
 keeptheir campaignsgoingformonthsoryears, meeting
 with their friends every week or so to pick up the story
 where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the
 campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each ad
venture completed, andeachtreasurerecoverednotonly
 adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventur
ers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected
 by an adventurer’s level.
 There’snowinningandlosingintheDungeons&Drag
ons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually
 understood. Together, the DM and the players create an
 exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly
 perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly
 end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a ne
farious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search
 for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the
 player might choose to create a new character to carry
 on. The group might fail to complete an adventure suc
cessfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a
 memorable story, they all win.
 Worlds of Adventure
 The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are
 places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and
 spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of
 medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and
 magic that make these worlds unique.
 The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist
 within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected
 in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to
 other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane
 of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within
 this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many
 of them have been published as official settings for the
 D&Dgame. Thelegends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag
onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron
 settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi
verse. A longside these worlds are hundreds of thou
sands more, created by generations of D&D players for
 their own games. And amid all the richness of the multi
verse, you might create a world of your own.
 All these worlds share characteristics, but each world
 is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive
 monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun
geons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual
 traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun
 3
setting, for exam ple, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and
 the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races
 unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged,
 soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last
 War. Someworldsaredominated byonegreat story, like
 the WaroftheLancethatplaysacentralroleintheDrag
onlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you can
 use the rules in this book to create a character and play
 in any one of them.
 Your DM might set the campaign on one of these
 worlds orononethatheorshecreated. Becausethereis
 so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should
 checkwithyourDMaboutanyhouserulesthatwillaffect
 your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master
 is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if
 the setting is a published world.
 Using This Book
 The Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts.
 Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the
 rules and guidance you needtomakethecharacteryou’ll
 play in the game. It includes information on the various
 races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other cus
tomization options that you can choose from. Many of
 the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If
 you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don’t
 understand, consult the book’s index.
 Part2detailstherulesofhowtoplaythegame,beyond
 the basics described in this introduction. That part cov
ers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success
 or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and de
scribes the three broad categories of activity in the game:
 exploration, interaction, and combat.
 Part 3is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic
 in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the
 hugevariety of spells available to magic-using characters
 (and monsters) in the game.
 HowtoPlay
 The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds ac
cording to this basic pattern.
 1. The DM describes the environment. The DM
 tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s
 around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
 present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,
 what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).
 2. Theplayersdescribewhattheywanttodo. Some
times one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
 “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, dif
ferent adventurers do different things: one adventurer
 might search a treasure chest while a second examines
 an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
 watchformonsters. Theplayersdon’tneedtotaketurns,
 but the DMlistens to every player and decides how to re
solve those actions.
 Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
 wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM
 might just say that the door opens and describe what lies
 beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might
 hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might
 makeit challenging for an adventurer to complete a task.
 In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often re
lying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an
 action.
 3. The DMnarrates the results of the adventurers’
 actions. Describing the results often leads to another
 decision point, which brings the flow of the game right
 back to step 1.
 This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau
tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
 locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In cer
tain situations, particularly combat, the action is more
 structured and the players (and DM)dotaketurnschoos
ing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
 f
 luid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the
 adventure.
 Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
 imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s
 verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like
 to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set
 the mood , and many players and DMs alike adopt dif
ferent voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and
 othercharacterstheyplayinthegame. Sometimes,aDM
 might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures
 to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the
 players keep track of where everyone is.
 GameDice
 Thegameusespolyhedraldicewithdifferentnumbersof
 sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in
 many book stores.
 In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
 letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10,
 d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
 typical cube that many games use).
 Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You
 generate a number between 1 and 100byrolling two dif
ferent ten-sided dice numberedfrom0to9. Onedie(des
ignated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other
 gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example,
 the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. Some
 ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so
 on), makingit easier to distinguish the tens digit from the
 ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00
 and 0 is 100.
 Whenyouneedtorolldice,therulestellyouhowmany
 dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to
 add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight
sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.
 Thesamednotationappears in the expressions “1d3”
 and“1d2”. Tosimulatetherollof1d3,rollad6anddivide
 the numberrolled by2(roundup). Tosimulatethe roll of
 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending
 on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the num
 ber rolled is more than half the number of sides on the
 die, it’s a 2.)
 The D20
 Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just
 bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an
 outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging
 river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
 or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In
 cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
 4
Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided
 die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
 Every character and monster in the game has capa
bilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are
 Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
 and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for
 mostadventurers. (Monstersmighthavescoresaslowas
 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability
 modifiersderivedfromthem,arethebasisforalmostev
ery d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or mon
ster’s behalf.
 Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
 three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
 rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.
 1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and
 add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier
 derived from one of the six ability scores, and it some
timesincludesaproficiencybonustoreflectacharacter’s
 particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability
 and howto determine an ability’s modifier.)
 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A
 class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some
 other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
 3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total
 equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
 attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a
 failure. The DMisusuallytheonewhodeterminestarget
 numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
 attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
 The target number for an ability check or a saving
 throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target num
ber for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
 This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks
 in D&Dplay. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
 using the d20 in the game.
 Advantage and Disadvantage
 Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
 is modified by special situations called advantage and
 disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circum
stances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage re
f
 lects the opposite. When you have either advantage or
 disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the
 roll. Use thehigherofthetworollsifyouhaveadvantage,
 and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For ex
ample, if youhavedisadvantageandrolla17anda5,you
 use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those
 numbers, you use the 17.
 More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage
 are presented in chapter 7.
 Specific Beats General
 This bookcontains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that
 govern howthegameplays. Thatsaid, manyracialtraits,
 class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and
 other game elements break the general rules in some
 way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game
 works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a
 general rule, the specific rule wins.
 Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance,
 many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows,
 but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That
 trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other ex
amples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For in
stance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls,
 but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for
 most of the major exceptions to the rules.
 RoundDown
 There’s one more general rule you need to know at the
 outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game,
 round downif youendupwithafraction, even if the frac
tion is one-half or greater.
 Adventures
 The Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of
 characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon
 Master presents to them. Each character brings partic
ular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability
 scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment,
 and magic items. Every character is different, with var
ious strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of ad
venturers is one in which the characters complement
 each other and cover the weaknesses of their compan
ions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully
 complete the adventure.
 The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with
 a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might
 be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the
 shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and
 desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic
 setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum
bling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
 features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers cre
ated and played by the other players at the table, as well
 asnonplayercharacters(NPCs). Thosecharactersmight
 be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background
 extras in anadventure. Often, oneoftheNPCsisavillain
 whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.
 Overthecourseoftheir adventures, the characters are
 confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situa
tions that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes
 the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill
 or capture each other in combat. At other times, the
 adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical
 object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers
 spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle,
 f
 ind something hidden, or unravel the current situation.
 Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making
 decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try
 to do next.
 Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short ad
venture might present only afewchallenges, andit might
 take no more than a single game session to complete. A
 long adventurecaninvolvehundredsofcombats, interac
tions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions
 to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real
 time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the
 adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and en
joy the spoils of their labors. But that’s not the end of the
 story. Youcanthinkofanadventureasasingleepisodeof

ing the narrative from start to finish.
 The Three Pillars of Adventure
 Adventurers can try to do anything their players can
 imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities
 in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction,
 and combat.
 Explorationincludes boththeadventurers’ movement
 through the world and their interaction with objects and
 situations that require their attention. Exploration is the
 give-and-take of the players describing what they want
 their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling
 the players what happens as a result. On a large scale,
 that mightinvolvethecharactersspendingadaycrossing
 a rolling plain or an hour making their way through cav
erns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean
 on e character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see
 what happens.
 Social interaction features the adventurers talking to
 someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding
 that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the
 goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
 pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading
 a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the
 adventurers.
 The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and
 social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3
 and personality traits in chapter 4.
 Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters
 and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,
 maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to
 defeat their opponents, whether that means killing ev
ery enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
 is the most structured element of a D&D session, with
 creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a
 chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
 there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to at
tempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on
 a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling
 a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures,
 including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
 The WondersofMagic
 Few D&D adventures end without something magical
 happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears
 frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus
 of chapters 10 and 11.
 In the worlds of Dungeons&Dragons, practitioners of
 magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by
 their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evi
denceofmagiconaregularbasis,butit’susuallyminor—
 a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wiz
ard walking through the streets with an animated shield
 guardian as a bodyguard.
 For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival.
 Withoutthehealingmagicofclericsandpaladins, adven
turers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without
 the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, war
riors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without
 the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and
 druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.
 tures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who

 adventurers might prevail!

Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
 Y
 our first step in playing an adventurer in the
 Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and
 create a character of your own. Your character
 is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying
 hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race
 (such as humanorhalfling) and a class (such as
 f
 ighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, ap
pearance, and backstory of your character. Once com
pleted, your character serves as your representative in
 the game, your avatar in the Dungeons&Dragonsworld.
 Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind
 of adventurer you want to play. You might be a coura
geous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flam
boyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an
 unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who
 likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks
 off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featur
ing dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of
 those races. Do you want your character to be the tough
est adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbar
ian orpaladin. Ifyoudon’tknowwhereelsetobegin,take
 a look at the illustrations in the official book to see what
 catches your interest.
 Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps
 in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
 want. Your conception of your character might evolve
 with each choice you make. What’s important is that you
 come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
 Throughout this chapter, we use the term character
 sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
 whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the
 end of the official book), some form of digital record, or a
 piece of notebook paper. AnofficialD&Dcharactersheet
 is a fine place to start until you know what information
 you need and how you use it during the game.
 Building Bruenor
 Each step of character creation includes an example of
 that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf
 character, Bruenor.
 1. Choose a Race
 Every character belongs to a race, one of the many
 intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The
 most commonplayercharacter races are dwarves, elves,
 halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces,
 such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 pro
vides more information about these races, as well as the
 less widespreadracesofdragonborn,gnomes,half-elves,
 half-orcs, and tieflings.
 The race you choose contributes to your character’s
 identity in animportantway, byestablishingageneralap
pearanceandthenaturaltalentsgainedfromcultureand
 ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial
 traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain
 weaponsortools, proficiencyinoneormoreskills, orthe
 ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dove
tail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2).
 For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make
 them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be pow
erful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be
 fun, too. Half-orc paladins and mountain dwarf wizards,
 for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.
 Your race also increases one or more of your ability
 scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these in
creases and remember to apply them later. Record the
 traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be
 sure to note yourstarting languages and your base speed
 as well.
 Building Bruenor, Step 1
 Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides
 that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants
 to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his
 character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the
 languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.
 2. Choose a Class
 Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly
 describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he
 or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely
 to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
 or engaginginatensenegotiation. Thecharacterclasses
 are described in chapter 3.
 Yourcharacterreceivesanumberofbenefitsfromyour
 choice of class. Many of these benefits are class fea
tures—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your
 character apart from members of other classes. You also
 gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills,
 saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies
 define many of the things your character can do partic
ularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a con
vincing lie.
 On your character sheet, record all the features that
 your class gives you at 1st level.
 Level
 Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in
 level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP).
 A1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring
 world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a
 pirate and done dangerous things before.
 Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry
 into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with
 thegame,orifyouarejoininganexistingD&Dcampaign,
 your DMmightdecidetohaveyoubeginatahigherlevel,
 on the assumption that your character has already sur
vived a few harrowing adventures.
 Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re
 starting at a higher level, record the additional elements
 your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record
 your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0XP. A
 higher-level character typically begins with the minimum

 including how to assign your highest ability scores, a back
ground suitable to the c1ass, and starting spells.
 7
amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond
 1st Level” later in this chapter).
 Hit Points and Hit Dice
 Your character’s hit points define how tough your char
acter is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your
 hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit
 Point Dice).
 At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die
 type is determined byyourclass. Youstart with hit points
 equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your
 class description. (You also add your Constitution modi
f
 ier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your
 hit point maximum.
 Record your character’s hit points on your character
 sheet. AlsorecordthetypeofHitDieyourcharacteruses
 and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you
 can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in
 chapter 8).
 Proficiency Bonus
 The table that appears in your class description shows
 your proficiency bonus, whichis +2fora1st-level charac
ter. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the num
bers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
 • Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
 • Attack rolls with spells you cast
 • Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
 • Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
 • Saving throws you’re proficient in
 • SavingthrowDCsforspellsyoucast(explainedineach
 spellcasting class)
 Your class determines your weaponproficiencies, your
 saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and
 tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7,
 tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional
 skill andtoolproficiencies, andsomeracesgiveyoumore
 proficiencies. Besuretonotealloftheseproficiencies,as
 well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.
 Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die
 roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your
 proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved,
 for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance sug
gests that your proficiency bonus applies more thanonce
 to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than
 once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only
 once, and halve it only once.
 Building Bruenor, Step 2
 Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe,
 one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a
 f
 ighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level
 class features on his character sheet.
 As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—
 and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution
 modifier. Bobnotesthis, andwillrecordthefinalnumber
 after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see
 step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st
level character, which is +2.
 3. Determine Ability Scores
 Much of what your character does in the game depends
 onhisorhersixabilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitu
tion, Intelligence, Wisdom,andCharisma. Eachability
 has a score, which is a number you record on your char
acter sheet.
 The six abilities and their use in the game are de
scribed in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary table
 provides a quick reference for what qualities are mea
sured by each ability, what races increases which abili
ties, and what classes consider each ability particularly
 important.
 You generate your character’s six ability scores ran
domly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the
 highestthreediceonapieceofscratchpaper. Dothisfive
 more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to
 save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining
 ability scores, you can use the following scores instead:
 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
 Nowtakeyoursixnumbersandwriteeachnumberbe
side one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores
 to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis
dom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to
 your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
 After assigning your ability scores, determine your
 ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers
 table. To determine an ability modifier without consult

 5. Choose Equipment
 Your class and background determine your character’s
 starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and
 other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your
 character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.
 Insteadoftakingthegeargiventoyoubyyourclassand
 background, you can purchase your starting equipment.
 You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based
 on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive lists of
 equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If
 you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see
 the trinket table at the end of chapter 5).
 Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you
 can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total
 weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times
 15. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capac
ity.
 Armor Class
 Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your char
acter avoids being wounded in battle. Things that con
tribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield
 you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters
 wear armor or carry shields, however.
 Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals
 10+hisorherDexteritymodifier. Ifyourcharacterwears
 armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using
 the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC onyourcharacter
 sheet.
 Your character needs to be proficient with armor and
 shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
 and shield proficiencies are determined by your class.
 There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
 shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained
 in chapter 5.
 Somespellsandclassfeatures give youadifferentway
 to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that
 give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose
 which one to use.
 Weapons
 For each weapon your character wields, calculate the
 modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and
 the damage you deal when you hit.
 When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a
 d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are
 proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability
 modifier.
 • For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength
 modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that
 has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your
 Dexterity modifier instead.
 • For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity
 modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon
 that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can
 use your Strength modifier instead.
 Building Bruenor, Step 5
 Bobwrites down the starting equipment from the fighter
 class and the folk hero background. His starting equip
mentincludes chain mail and a shield, which combine to
 give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.
 For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and
 two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so
 Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and
 damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3)
 plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The bat
tleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his
 Strength modifier to the damage whenhehits, for a total
 of 1d8+3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe,
 Bruenorhasthesameattackbonus(handaxes,asthrown
 weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the
 weapon deals 1d6+3 slashing damage when it hits.
 6. ComeTogether
 Most D&D characters don’t work alone. Each charac
ter plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers
 workingtogetherforacommonpurpose. Teamworkand
 cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to sur
vive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Drag
ons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide
 whether your characters know one another, how they
 met, andwhatsortsofqueststhegroupmightundertake.
 Beyond 1st Level
 As your character goes on adventures and overcomes
 challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by
 experience points. A character who reaches a specified
 experience point total advances in capability. This ad
vancement is called gaining a level.
 When your character gains a level, his or her class of
ten grants additional features, as detailed in the class de
scription. Some of these features allow you to increase
 yourability scores, eitherincreasingtwoscoresby1each
 or increasing one scoreby2. Youcan’tincreaseanability
 score above20. Inaddition, every character’s proficiency
 bonus increases at certain levels.
 Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit
 Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier
 to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
 hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed
 value shown in your class entry, which is the average re
sult of the die roll (rounded up).
 When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your
 hit point maximumincreasesby1foreachlevelyouhave
 attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level
 as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17
 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3
 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

Tiers of Play
 Character Advancement
 Level
 Proficiency Bonus
 Theshading in the Character Advancement table show s
 the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules asso
ciated with them; they are a general description of how
 the play experience changes as characters gain levels.
 In the first tier (levels 1-4 ), characters are effectively
 apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features
 that define them as members of particular classes, in
cluding the major choices that flavor their class features
 as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or
 a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are
 relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farm
 steads or villages.
 In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters come into
 their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level
 spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold
 of magical power with spells such as fireball and light
ning bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain
 the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These
 characters have become important, facing dangers that
 threaten cities and kingdoms.
 In thethird tier (levels 11-16), characters have reached
 a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary
 populace and makes them special even among adventur
ers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th
level spells, some of which create effects previously im
possible for player characters to achieve. Other charac
ters gain features that allow them to make more attacks
 or do more impressive things with those attacks. These
 mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole re
gions and continents.
 At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve the
 pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or vil
lainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the
 world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse
 might hang in the balance during their adventures.

Chapter 2: Races
 Racial Traits
 A
 visit to one of the great cities in the
 worlds of Dungeons & Dragons—Waterdeep,
 the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny
 Sigil, the City of Doors—overwhelms the
 senses. Voices chatter in countless different
 languages. The smells of cooking in dozens
 of different cuisines mingle with the odors of
 crowdedstreetsandpoorsanitation. Buildingsinmyriad
 architectural styles display the diverse origins of their in
habitants.
 And the people themselves—people of varying size,
 shape, andcolor, dressedinadazzlingspectrumofstyles
 and hues—represent many different races, from diminu
tive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful
 elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.
 Scattered amongthemembersofthesemorecommon
 races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here,
 pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling
 there, lurking in the shadowswithmischiefinhereyes. A
 group of gnomeslaughsasoneofthemactivates aclever
 wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Halfelves and
 half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully
 belonging to the races of either of their parents. And
 there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive
 from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying
 to make his way in a world that fears his kind.
 Choosing a Race
 Humans are the most common people in the worlds of
 D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves,
 halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your
 character belongs to one of these peoples.
 Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropri
ate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves,
 halflings, andhumansarethemostcommonracestopro
ducethesortofadventurerswhomakeuptypicalparties.
 Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings
 are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of
 elves, are also uncommon.
 Your choice of race affects many different aspects of
 your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that
 exist throughout your character’s adventuring career.
 When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of
 character you want to play. For example, a halfling could
 be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes
 a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane
 magic.
 Your character race not only affects your ability scores
 and traits but also provides the cues for building your
 character’s story. Each race’s description in this chap
ter includes information to help you roleplay a charac
ter of that race, including personality, physical appear
ance, features of society, and racial alignment tenden
cies. These details are suggestions to help you think
 about your character; adventurers can deviate widely
 from the norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider
 why your character is different, as a helpful way to think
 about your character’s background and personality.

 common to members of that race. The following entries
 appear among the traits of most races.
 Ability Score Increase
 Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability
 scores.
 Age
 Theageentrynotestheagewhenamemberoftheraceis
 considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifes
pan. This information can help you decide how old your
 character is at the start of the game. You can choose any
 age for your character, which could provide an explana
tion for some of your ability scores. For example, if you
 play a young or very old character, your age could ex
plain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score,
 while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence
 or Wisdom.
 Alignment
 Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments,
 described in this entry. These are not binding for player
 characters, butconsideringwhyyourdwarfischaotic,for
 example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you
 better define your character.
 Size
 Characters of most races are Medium, asize category in
cluding creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Mem
bers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall),
 which means that certain rules of the game affect them
 differently. The most important of these rules is that
 Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons,
 as explained in chapter 6.
 Speed
 Your speed determines how far you can move when trav
eling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).
 Languages
 By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read,
 and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most
 commonlanguages of the D&D multiverse.
 Subraces
 Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have
 the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits spec
ified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces
 vary significantly fromracetoraceandworldtoworld. In
 the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, moun
tain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different
 clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms,
 they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call them
selves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.

Dwarf
 Slow to Trust
 “Yerlate,elf!” Cametheroughedgeofafamiliarvoice.
 Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact
 that the heavy monster lay on top of his elvenfriend. In spite of the added dis
comfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though
 still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble
 if I came out an’ looked for ye!”
 —R. A. Salvatore, TheCrystal Shard
 Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into
 the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and ham
mersindeepminesandblazingforges, a commitmentto
 clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and
 orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.
 Short and Stout
 Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors,
 miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they
 stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and
 compact that they can weigh as much as a human stand
ing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance
 are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
 Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue
 tinged with red, but the most common shades are light
 brownordeeptan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair,
 worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or
 brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male
 dwarves value their beards highly and groom them care
fully.
 Long Memory,LongGrudges
 Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the
 oldest living dwarves often remember a very different
 world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living
 in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)
 can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when
 orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile
 that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
 perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as
 humans and halflings lack.
 Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains
 they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic
 endurance and little change. They respect the traditions
 of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the found
ing of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the
 world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of
 those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves,
 whouphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill
 in battle, and devotion to the forge.
 Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to
 their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point
 of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of
 justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suf
fered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the
 dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt
 for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
 Clans and Kingdoms
 Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains
 where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and
 forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry
 of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves
 Dwarvesgetalongpassablywellwithmostotherraces. “The
 difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a
 hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole,
 but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member
 of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.
 Elves. “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling
 what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s
 head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword.
 They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them,
 though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they
 have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come
 streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have
 at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt
 they hate the orcs as much as we do.”
 Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a
 halfling hero. Anempire, atriumphantarmy. Evenatreasure
 for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you
 take them seriously?”
 Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human,
 and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky,
 she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s
 got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can
 make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their
 hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s
 hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind
 of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than
 not.”
 this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they
 can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade.
 They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings
 frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water
 routes. Trustworthy members of other races are wel
come in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off
 limits even to them.
 The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and
 dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who
 live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan iden
tities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and in
voke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be
 clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
 Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, espe
cially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some be
comemercenariesorbodyguards, highly sought after for
 their courage and loyalty.
 Gods, Gold, and Clan
 Dwarves whotakeuptheadventuring life might be moti
vated by adesire for treasure—for its own sake, for a spe
cific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help
 others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or in
spiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to
 bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ances
try are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to
 restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the
 clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after
 having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe
 wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle
 centuries ago.

Dwarf Names
 A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accor
dance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has
 been used and reused down through the generations. A
 dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.
 A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name
 is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any
 dwarven name in its place.

 guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
 whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
 Subraces. Two main subraces of dwarves populate
 the worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
 Choose one of these subraces.
 Hill Dwarf
 Asahill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and
 remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun in
 their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are
 the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the
 Dragonlance setting.

 Mountain Dwarf
 As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accus
tomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re proba
bly on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter
 coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerun, as
 well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan
 of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in

 Dwarven Armor Training. You have proficiency with
 light and medium armor.
 Duergar
 In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray
 dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the sur
face world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races
 of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to be
come invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

Elf
 Haughty but Gracious
 “I have never imagined such beauty existed,” Goldmoon
 said softly. Theday’smarchhadbeendifficult,buttherewardattheendwasbeyond
 their dreams. ThecompanionsstoodonahighcliffoverthefabledcityofQualinost.
 Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their bril
liant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swoopingfrom spire
 to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they
 were strong enough to hold the weight of an army,yet they appeared so delicate
 that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches
 were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city
 opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.
 —Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, DragonsofAutumnTwilight
 Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, liv
ing in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in
 places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests
 or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft
 musicdriftsthroughtheairandgentlefragranceswafton
 the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry,
 music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
 Slender and Graceful
 Withtheirunearthlygraceandfinefeatures,elvesappear
 hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many
 other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on
 average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over
 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing
 only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about
 the same height, and males are only marginally heavier
 than females.
 Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human
 range andalso includes skin in shades of copper, bronze,
 and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes
 like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and
 little body hair. They favor elegant cloth in gin bright col
ors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.
 ATimeless Perspective
 Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
 perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived
 races more deeply. They are more often amused than ex
cited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They
 tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.
 Whenpursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on
 a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be fo
cused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and
 enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply
 to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with
 vengeance.
 Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in
 the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compro
mise to resolve differences before they escalate to vio
lence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions
 into their woodland homes, confident that they can sim
ply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises,
 elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with
 sword, bow, and strategy.
 Hidden WoodlandRealms
 Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among
 the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow veg
etables, and their skill and magic allow them to support
 Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious
 even to those who fall short of their high expectations—
 which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just
 about anyone.
 Dwarves. “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they
 lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they makeup in
 valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that
 approaches elven quality.”
 Halflings. “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and
 that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care
 for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven
 themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”
 Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to
 accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—
 human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you
 look at what they have accomplished, and you have to ap
preciate their achievements. If only they could slowdown
 and learn some refinement.”
 themselves without the need for clearing and plowing
 land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked
 clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is
 usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by
 trading crafted items for metals (which they have no in
terest in mining).
 Elves encountered outside their own lands are com
monly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human no
bles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach
 swordplay or magic to their children.
 Exploration and Adventure
 Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they
 are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration
 and discovery. They dislike the pace of human soci
ety, which is regimented from day to day but constantly
 changing over decades, so they find careers that let them
 travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy ex
ercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magi
cal power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some
 might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and
 others might become champions of moral causes.
 Elf Names
 Elves are considered children until they declare them
selves adults, sometime after the hundredth birthday,
 and before this period they are called by child names.
 On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name,
 although those who knew him or her as a youngster
 might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult
 name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the
 namesofrespectedindividuals or other family members.
 Little distinction exists between male names and female
 names; the groupings here reflect only general tenden
cies. In addition, everyelfbearsafamilyname, typicallya
 combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling
 among humans translate their family names into Com
mon, but others retain the Elvish version.

 Elf Traits
 Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the
 result of thousands of years of elven refinement.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in

 Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about
 the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
 adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass
 worldly experience. Anelftypicallyclaimsadulthoodand
 an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be
 750 years old.
 Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self
expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler as
pects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom
 as well as their own, and they are more often good than
 not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Un
derdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow
 are more often evil than not.
 Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
 have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
 Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 Darkvision. Accustomedtotwilitforestsandthenight
 sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
 You can see in dimlight within 60 feet of you as if it were
 bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
 can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception
 skill.
 Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws
 against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
 Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they medi
tate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
 (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”)
 While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
 dreams are actually mental exercises that have become
 reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
 way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from
 8 hours of sleep.
 Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common
 andElvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and in
tricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and
 their songs and poems are famous among other races.
 Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish
 ballads to their repertoires.
 Subraces. Ancient divides among the elven people re
sulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves,
 and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose
 one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces
 are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon
 elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can
 choose a narrower subrace.
 High Elf
 As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at
 least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D,
 there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which in
cludes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the
 Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the For
gotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing them
selves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves.
 Theothertype(includingthehighelvesofGreyhawk. the
 QualinestiofDragonlance,andthemoonelvesoftheFor
gotten Realms)aremorecommonandmorefriendly,and
 often encountered among humans and other races.
 The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sun
rise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black,
 or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black.
 Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are
 much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with
 blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,
 but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not un
common. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with
 gold.

 WoodElf
 As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and
 your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through
 your native forests. This category includes the wild
 elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Drag
onlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Grey
hawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves
 (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are
 reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.
 Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, some
times with traces of green. Their hair tends toward
 brownsandblacks,butitisoccasionallyblondorcopper

 Dark Elf (Drow)
 Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned
 elves, the drow were banished from the surface world
 17
for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and
 corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in
 the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of
 Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin
 that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale
 yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale
 as tobemistakenforwhite)inshadesoflilac, silver, pink,
 red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than
 most elves.

 Drow Weapon Training. You have proficiency with

 The Darkness of the Drow
 Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow
 would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of
 demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean
 depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest
 nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they de
spise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the
 favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder
 and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie
 for position.
 Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the
 ForgottenRealms,DrizztDo’Urden,rangeroftheNorth,has
 proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak
 and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world
 that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a
 model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying
 to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark
 homes.
 Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are
 inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a
 conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members
 of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, espe
cially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.

Halfling
 Affable and Positive
 Regis the halfling, the only one of his kind for hun
dreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers behind his head and leaned back
 against the mossy blanket of the tree trunk. Regis was short, even by the standards
 of his diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely cresting the
 three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or
 several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as
 his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out
 over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.
 —R.A. Salvatore, TheCrystal Shard
 The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’
 lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from ma
rauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire
 and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
 Though somehalflings live out their days in remote agri
cultural communities, others form nomadic bands that
 travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide
 horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peo
ples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth,
 and home, thoughhomemightbeawagonjostlingalong
 a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
 Small and Practical
 The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
 creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding of
fense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively
 harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
 in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
 political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing
 between 40 and 45 pounds.
 Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy
 cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and
 wavy. They have brownorhazeleyes. Halfling menoften
 sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them
 and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple,
 comfortable, andpracticalclothes, favoringbrightcolors.
 Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.
 They’re concerned with basic needs and simple plea
suresandhavelittle useforostentation. Eventhewealth
iest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar
 rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack
 for finding the most straightforward solution to a prob
lem, and have little patience for dithering.
 Kind andCurious
 Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cher
ish the bonds of family andfriendship as well as the com
forts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold
 or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture
 into the worldforreasonsofcommunity,friendship, wan
derlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things,
 even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamil
iar style of clothing.
 Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any
 living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing
 what they have even in lean times.
 Blend into the Crowd
 Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of hu
mans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable
 and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth
 Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to
 make sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones.
 Dwarves. “Dwarvesmakeloyalfriends, andyoucancount
 on themto keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile
 once in a while?”
 Elves. “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their
 graceandall. It’s like they steppedoutofawonderfuldream.
 But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling
 faces—surely more than they ever let on.”
 Humans. “Humans area lot like us, really. At least some
 of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to
 the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not
 that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—
 you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their
 own lands, they protect us as well.”
 and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid un
wanted attention.
 Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal
 to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can
 display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families,
 or communities are threatened.
 Pastoral Pleasantries
 Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with
 large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build king
doms of their own or even hold much land beyond their
 quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of
 halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family el
ders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional
 ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
 Many halflings live among other races, where the
 halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abun
dant rewardsandcreature comforts. Somehalflingcom
munities travel as a wayoflife, driving wagons or guiding
 boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent
 home.
 Exploring Opportunities
 Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to de
fend their communities, support their friends, or explore
 a wideandwonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is
 less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a neces
sity.

Human
 Everyone’s Second-Best Friends
 Thesewerethestoriesofarestlesspeoplewholongago
 took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to pillage and terrorize, then to settle.
 Yet there was an energy, a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into
 the night Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.
 She’d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her. In
 these yellowed pages were tales of bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty
 primitive gods, and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.
 —Elaine Cunningham, DaughteroftheDrow
 In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the
 youngestofthecommonraces,latetoarriveontheworld
 scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves,
 and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives
 that theystrivetoachieveasmuchastheycanintheyears
 they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something
 to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their
 mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.
 Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the
 achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.
 ABroadSpectrum
 Withtheir penchantformigrationandconquest, humans
 are more physically diverse than other common races.
 There is no typical human. An individual can stand from
 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to
 250pounds. Humanskinshadesrangefromnearlyblack
 to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly,
 kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is
 sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhu
man blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages.
 Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely
 live even a single century.
 Variety in All Things
 Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people
 among the common races. They have widely varying
 tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands
 where they have settled. When they settle, though, they
 stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great king
doms that can persist for long centuries. An individ
ual human might have a relatively short lifespan, but a
 human nation or culture preserves traditions with ori
gins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory.
 Theylive fully in the present—makingthemwellsuitedto
 the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving
 to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, hu
mans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to
 changing political and social dynamics.
 Lasting Institutions
 Whereasingleelfordwarfmighttakeontheresponsibil
ity of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, hu
mans found sacred orders and institutions for such pur
poses. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the
 ancient traditions to each new generation, human tem
ples, governments,libraries, andcodesoflawfixtheirtra
ditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of im
mortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or
 divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve
 it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they
 are gone.
 Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle
 with members of other races. They get along with almost
 everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans
 serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants,
 and functionaries of all kinds.
 Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to
 their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
 Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They
 don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as pep
pered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned
 racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn
 a lot from them.”
 Halflings. “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as
 long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good food
 and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings
 had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to some
thing.”
 Although some humanscanbexenophobic, in general
 their societies are inclusive. Humanlandswelcomelarge
 numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of
 humans wholive in nonhuman lands.
 Exemplars of Ambition
 Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and
 ambitiousmembersofadaringandambitiousrace. They

 power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, hu
manschampioncausesratherthanterritories or groups.
 HumanNamesandEthnicities
 Having so much more variety than other cultures, hu
mans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
 parents give their children names from other languages,
 such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less
 correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to
 their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their
 ancestors.
 Thematerialcultureandphysicalcharacteristicsofhu

gotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture,
 cuisine, music, and literature are different in the north

mishorImpilturtotheeast—andevenmoredistinctivein
 far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though,
 vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest
 humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have
 every possible variation of coloration and features.
 In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups
 are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are
 found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups,
 and the typical names of their members, can be used as
 inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

Dragonborn
 UncommonRaces
 Her father stood on the first of the three stairs that
 led downfromtheportal,unmoving. Thescalesofhisfacehadgrownpaleraround
 the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could wrestle down a dire bear
 himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale
 armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as well, the mark
 of some foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had
 carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of
 Arush Vayem.
 Forall herlife, Farideh hadknownthatreadingherfather’sfacewasaskillshe’d

 would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen’s face. But
 the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth—her
 father’s face spoke volumes.
 But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still—the indifference of a
 dragon, even to Farideh.
 —Erin M. Evans, TheAdversary
 Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the drag
onborn walk proudly through a world that greets them
 with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic
 gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally
 hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining
 the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some
 dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others
 form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others
 f
 ind themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
 Proud DragonKin
 Dragon born look very much like dragons standing erect
 in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The
 f
 irst dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the
 colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreed
ing have created a more uniform appearance. Their
 small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color,
 sometimesrangingtoscarlet,rust, gold, orcopper-green.
 They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to
 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their
 hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fin
gers and a thumb on each hand.
 The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very
 strong through some dragonborn clans. These drag
onborn often boast scales that more closely match those
 of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or
 white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver,
 brass, copper, or bronze.
 Self-Sufficient Clans
 Toanydragonborn,theclanismoreimportantthanlifeit
self. Dragon born owe their devotion and respect to their
 clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s
 conductreflectsonthehonorofhisorherclan,andbring
ing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and ex
ile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and du
ties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the
 bounds of that position.
 Acontinual drive for self-improvement reflects the self
sufficiency of theraceasawhole. Dragonbornvalueskill
 and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and
 they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give
 upon something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a par
ticular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races
 The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are
 uncommon. They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and
 even where they are found, they are less widespread than
 dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
 In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most
 people hardly look twice at members of even the mostexotic
 races. But the small towns and villages that dot the country
side are different. The common folk aren’t accustomed to
 seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly.
 Dragonborn. It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a
 monster, especially if his or her scales betray achromaticher
itage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and caus
ing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with
 caution rather than outright fear.
 Gnome. Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly
 disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are
 often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one
 before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.
 Half-Elf. Although many people have never seen a half
elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger’s
 arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf’s back and
 stolen glances across the common room, rather than any
 confrontation or open curiosity.
 Half-Orc. It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is
 belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves
 around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surrepti
tiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes
 in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight
 will break out soon.
 Tiefling. Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution,
 but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil
 of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as
 far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well
 be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make
 warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to
 avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can
 enter.
 whoshare the same commitment find it easy to earn the
 respect of a dragonborn.
 Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they
 recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situ
ations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and
 when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn
 clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from
 the gods.

 Draconians
 In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess
 Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the eggs
 of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called dra
conians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five
 types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of
 the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), ka

Gnome
 Always Appreciative
 Skinnyandflaxen-haired,hisskinwalnutbrownandhis
 eyes a startling turquoise. Burgell stood half as tall as Aeron and had to climb up
 onastool to look out the peephole. Like most habitations in Oeble. that particular
 tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting
 awkwardness as best they could.
 But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack
 in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained
 a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses,
 jeweler’s loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells.
 A fat gray cat, the mage’s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes,
 gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep.
 —Richard Lee Byers, TheBlackBouquet
 A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens
 and neighborhoods where gnomes form their closeknit
 communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a
 crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there,
 a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of
 laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every mo
ment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation,
 and play.
 Vibrant Expression
 A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines
 through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes av
erage slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds.
 Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad
 smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright
 eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a ten
dency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the
 gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.
 A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her ap
pearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild
 hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curi
ous forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usu
ally madeinmodestearthtones, iselaborately decorated
 with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.
 Delighted Dedication
 As far as gnomesare concerned, being alive is a wonder
ful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out
 of their three to five centuries of life. Humansmightwon
deraboutgettingboredoverthecourseofsuchalonglife,
 and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the
 world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that
 even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the
 things they want to do and see.
 Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of
 their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and
 opinionsonarangeofsubjects,theystillmanagetolisten
 carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations
 of surprise and appreciation along the way.
 Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly
 punsandpranks,they’rejustasdedicatedtothemorese
rious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled en
gineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re will
ing to makemistakes and laugh at themselves in the pro
cess of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes
 foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.
 It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he
 or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that
 most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy
 anyone’s company just as they enjoy everything else they set
 out to do.
 Bright Burrows
 Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They
 live underground but get morefresh air than dwarvesdo,
 enjoying the natural, living world on the surface when
evertheycan. Theirhomesarewellhiddenbybothclever
 construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are
 quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those
 who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows
 in the first place. Gnomes who settle in human lands
 are commonly gem cutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers.
 Somehumanfamiliesretaingnometutors,ensuringthat
 their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted
 enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of
 a single human family over the course of his or her long
 life.
 GnomeNames
 Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so.
 A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles
 each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames
 from just about everyone else might or might not stick
 overtime. Gnome names are typically variants on the
 namesof ancestors or distant relatives, though some are
 purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and
 others who are “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to
 use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan
 name,andanickname,choosingtheoneineachcategory
 that’s the most fun to say.

 Seeing the World
 Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adven
turing as a way to see the world or for the love of ex
ploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some

monwith all other gnomes.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score in
creases by 2.
 Age. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do,
 and most are expected to settle down into an adult life
 by aroundage40. Theycanlive350toalmost500years.
 Alignment. Gnomes are most often good. Those who
 tendtowardlawaresages,engineers,researchers,schol
ars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward
 chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful
 jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the trick
sters among them are more playful than vicious.
 Size. Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and aver
age about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
 Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
 Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you
 have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
 see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
 light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t
 discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 Gnome Cunning. You have advantage on all Intel
ligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against
 magic.
 Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common
 and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the
 Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises
 and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.
 Subrace. Two subraces of gnomes are found among
 the worlds of D&D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes.
 Choose one of these subraces.
 Forest Gnome
 As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illu
sion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds
 of D&D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They
 gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using il
lusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats
 or to mask their escape should they be detected. For
est gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited
 woodlandfolk,andtheyregardelvesandgoodfeyastheir
 mostimportantallies. Thesegnomesalsobefriendsmall
 forest animals and rely on them for information about
 threats that might prowl their lands.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in
creases by 1.
 Natural Illusionist. You know the minor illusion
 cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
 Speak with Small Beasts. Through sound sand ges
tures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or
 smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often
 keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers,
 and other creatures as beloved pets.
 Rock Gnome
 As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and
 hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in
 the worlds of D&Darerockgnomes,including the tinker
 gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in
creases by 1.
 Artificer’s Lore. Whenever you make an Intelligence
 (History) check related to magic items, alchemical ob
jects, or technological devices, you can add twice your
 proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you
 normally apply.
 Tinker. You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tin
ker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and
 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork
 device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after
 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep
 the device functioning), or when you use your action to
 dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials
 used to create it. You can have up to three such devices
 active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of
 the following options:
 Clockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, mon
ster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
 soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet
 across the ground on each of your turns in a random di
rection. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it
 represents.
 Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame,
 which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire.
 Using the device requires your action.
 MusicBox. Whenopened,thismusicboxplaysasingle
 song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when
 it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.
 Deep Gnomes
 A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or
 svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the Un
derdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are
 as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor
 and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environ
ment, andtheir inventive expertise is directed mostly toward
 stonework.

Half-Elf
 Excellent Ambassadors
 Flint squinted intothesettingsun. Hethoughthesaw
 the figure of a manstriding up the path. Standing, Flint drew back into the shadow
 of a tall pine to see better. The man’s walk was marked by an easy grace—an elvish
 grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’s body had the thickness and tight muscles
 of a human, while the facial hair was deftnitely humankind’s. All the dwarf could
 see of the man’s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownish-red beard.
 A longbow was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side. He was
 dressed in soft leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves loved. But
 no elf in the world of Krynn could grow a beard... no elf, but ...
 “Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.
 “The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide grin. He held open
 his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted
 him offthe ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant, then,
 remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed himself from the half-elf’s embrace.
 —Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, DragonsofAutumnTwilight
 Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither,
 half-elves combinewhatsomesayarethebestqualitiesof
 their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventive
ness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love
 of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves
 live among humans, set apart by their emotional and
 physical differences, watchingfriendsandlovedonesage
 while time barely touches them. Others live with the
 elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the
 timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live
 as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either soci
ety, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other
 misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.
 OfTwoWorlds
 To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they
 look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents,
 thoughthey’re neither as slender as elves nor asbroadas
 humans. Theyrangefromunder5feettoabout6feettall,
 andfrom100to180pounds,withmenonlyslightlytaller
 andheavierthanwomen. Half-elfmendohavefacialhair,
 and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ances
try. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere be
tween their human andelf parents, and thus show a vari
ety even more pronounced than that found among either
 race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.
 Diplomats or Wanderers
 Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are
 welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome
 in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves
 and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes nu
merous enough to form small communities of their own.
 They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only peo
ple who truly understand what it is to live between these
 two worlds. In most parts of the world, though, half
elves are uncommonenoughthatonemightliveforyears
 without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid
 company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers,
 foresters, hunters, or adventurersandvisitingcivilization
 only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wander
lust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast,
 throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their
 charismaandsocialskillstogreatuseindiplomaticroles
 or as swindlers.
 Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with every
one, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a
 race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and hu
man energy without human boorishness. They often make
 excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between
 elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of
 favoring the other).
 Half-Elf Names
 Half-elves use either human or elven naming conven
tions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit into
 either society, half-elves raised among humans are often
 given elven names, and those raised among elves often
 take human names.
 Half-Elf Traits
 Your half-elf character has some qualities in common
 with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score in
creases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice
 increase by 1.
 Age. Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do
 and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live
 muchlongerthanhumans,however,oftenexceeding180
 years.
 Alignment. Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their
 elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and
 creative expression, demonstrating neither love of lead
ers nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent
 others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at
 least unpredictable.
 Size. Half-elves are about the same size as humans,
 ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
 Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 Darkvision. Thanks to your elf blood, you have supe
rior vision in darkanddimconditions. Youcanseeindim
 light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
 darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color
 in darkness, only shades of gray.
 Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws
 against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
 Skill Versatility. You gain proficiency in two skills of
 your choice.
 Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common,
 Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

Half-Orc
 Grudging Acceptance
 The warchief Mhurren roused himself from his sleep
ing-furs and his women and pulled a short hauberk of heavy steel rings over his
 thick, well-muscled torso. He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had
 a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight less bothersome
 than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his
 strength, his fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish against a
 warrior—providedhewaseverybitasstrong,enduring,andbloodthirstyashisfull
blooded kin. Half-orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn't last long
 amongtheBloodySkullsoranyotherorctribeforthatmatter. Butitwasoftentrue
 that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition,
 andself-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that
 could muster two thousand spears, and the strangest chief in Thar.
 —Richard Baker, Swordmage
 Whether united under the leadership of a mighty war
lock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict,
 orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining
 forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands
 nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages,
 half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud
 chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an
 edgeovertheir full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into
 the world to prove their worth among humans and other
 morecivilized races. Many of these becomeadventurers,
 achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety
 for their barbaric customs and savage fury.
 Scarred and Strong
 Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jut
ting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make
 their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand
 between 6 and7feet tall and usually weigh between 180
 and 250 pounds. Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of
 pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other
 scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave
 or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among
 or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of hu
miliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and
 injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might dis
play these scars proudly or hide them in shame.
 The MarkofGruumsh
 The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even
 those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully es
cape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though
 their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish
 heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh
 in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that
 simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exulta
tion when they join in melee combat—and either exult
 along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half
orcs are notevil bynature, but evil does lurk within them,
 whether they embrace it or rebel against it. Beyond the
 rageofGruumsh,half-orcsfeelemotionpowerfully. Rage
 doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies

 Half-Orc Names
 Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture
 in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit
 in among humans might trade an orc name for a hu
man name. Some half-orcs with human names decide
 to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes
 them more intimidating.

 reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably
 faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.
 Alignment. Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos
 from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined to
ward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to

 Dwarvish script.

Tiefling
 Mutual Mistrust
 “But you do see the way people look at you, devil’s
 child.”
 Those black eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring right into her heart and
 the sudden seriousness in his voice jolted her.
 “What is it they say?” he asked. “One’s a curiosity, two’s a conspiracy—”
 “Three’sacurse,” shefinished. “YouthinkIhaven’theardthatrubbishbefore?”
 “Iknowyouhave.” Whensheglaredathim,headded,“It’snotasifI’mplumb
ing the depths of your mind, dear girl. That is the burden of every tiefling. Some
 break under it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some revel in it.”
 He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with that wicked glint in his eyes. “You
 f
 ight it, don’t you? Like a little wildcat, I wager. Every little jab and comment just
 sharpens your c1aws.”
 —Erin M. Evans, BrimstoneAngels
 To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer vi
olence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
 fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And
 to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because
 a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of
 Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their blood
line. Theirappearanceandtheirnaturearenottheirfault
 but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their
 children and their children’s children will always beheld
 accountable.
 Infernal Bloodline
 Tieflings are derived from human blood lines, and in the
 broadest possible sense, they still look human. How
ever, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on
 their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take
 any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like
 a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s,
 and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They
 have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil
 around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
 canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid
 colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible
 sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of
 humancoloration, butalsoincludevariousshadesofred.
 Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is
 usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or
 purple.
 Self-Reliant and Suspicious
 Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in
 human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters
 of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers,
 thieves, or crimelords. Sometimestheyliveamongother
 minority populations in enclaves where they are treated
 with more respect. Lacking a homeland, tieflings know
 that they have to make their own way in the world and
 that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick
 to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a
 tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or
 her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.
 Andonceatiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a
 f
 irm friend or ally for life.
 Tiefling Names
 Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings
 born into another culture typically have names reflective

 demagoguesblametieflingsforstrangehappenings. There
ality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his
 or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with
 mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they re
spond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the
 wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are sim

fernal descent.
 Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score in
creases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
 Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but
 live a few years longer.
 Alignment. Tieflings might not have an innate ten
dency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil
 or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings to
ward a chaotic alignment.
 Size. Tieflings are about the same size and build as
 humans. Your size is Medium.
 Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you

 Class is the primary definition of what your
 character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your
 character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about
 the world and interact with it and your relationship with
 other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter,
 for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of
 strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn
 in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see
 himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a
 conflict brewing amongvarious deities. While the fighter
 has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric
 might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees
 who share his faith.
 Your class gives you a variety of special features, such

 and your existing features often improve. Each class en

efits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of
 each one.
 Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one
 class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear
 the oath of a paladin. A barbarian might discover latent

 in almost every D&D world and define the spectrum of
 typical adventurers.

Proficiencies
 Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
 Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons
 Tools: None
 Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution
 Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, In
timidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival
 Equipment
 You start with the following equipment, in addition to the
 equipment granted by your background:
 • (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
 • (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
 • Anexplorer’s pack and four javelins
 Rage
 In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you
 can enter a rage as a bonus action.
 While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
 aren’t wearing heavy armor:
 • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
 saving throws.
 • When you make a melee weapon attack using
 Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that in
creases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in
 the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
 • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
 slashing damage.
 If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
 concentrate on them while raging.
 Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
 knockedunconsciousorifyourturnendsandyouhaven’t
 attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken
 damage since then. You can also end your rage on your
 turn as a bonus action.
 Once you have raged the number of times shown for
 your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbar
ian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage
 again.
 Unarmored Defense
 While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class
 equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
 modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
 Reckless Attack
 Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
 for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you
 make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to at
tack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee
 weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but
 attack rolls against you have advantage until your next
 turn.
 Danger Sense
 At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
 nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when
 you dodge away from danger.
 YouhaveadvantageonDexteritysavingthrowsagainst
 effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain
 this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapaci
tated.
 Primal Path
 At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
 your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
 of the TotemWarrior, bothdetailed at the end oftheclass
 description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
 and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Extra Attack
 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
 once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 Fast Movement
 Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet
 while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.
 Feral Instinct
 By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
 advantage on initiative rolls.
 Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
 combatandaren’tincapacitated, you can act normally on
 yourfirstturn, butonlyifyouenteryourragebeforedoing
 anything else on that turn.
 Brutal Critical
 Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
 weapondamagediewhendeterminingtheextradamage
 for a critical hit with a melee attack.
 This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and
 three additional dice at 17th level.
 Relentless Rage
 Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
 despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
 while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
 a DC10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
 drop to 1 hit point instead.
 Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC
 increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
 DCresets to 10.
 Persistent Rage
 Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends
 early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end
 it.
 Indomitable Might
 Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check
 is less than your Strength score, you can use that score
 in place of the total.
 35
Primal Champion
 At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your
 Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
 maximumfor those scores is now 24.
 Primal Paths
 Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that
 drives him or hertowardgreatness. Different barbarians
 attribute their rage to different sources, however. For
 some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and
 anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it
 as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.
 Path of the Berserker
 For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that
 end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
 of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the
 berserker’s rage, youthrill in the chaosofbattle, heedless
 of your own health or well-being.
 Frenzy
 Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can
 go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the du
ration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon
 attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this
 one. Whenyourrageends,yousufferonelevelofexhaus
tion (as described in appendix A).
 Mindless Rage
 Beginningat6thlevel,youcan’tbecharmedorfrightened
 while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you
 enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration
 of the rage.
 Intimidating Presence
 Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
 frighten someone with your menacing presence. When
 you do so, choose one creature that you can see within
 30feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must
 succeed onaWisdomsavingthrow(DCequalto8+your
 proficiency bonus + yourCharismamodifier)orbefright
ened of you until the end of your next turn. On subse
quent turns, you can use your action to extend the dura
tion of this effect on the frightened creature until the end
 of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its
 turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from
 you.
 If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t
 use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
 Retaliation
 Starting at14thlevel, whenyoutakedamagefromacrea
ture that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction
 to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
 Path of the TotemWarrior
 The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as
 the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
 and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with
 supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbar
ian rage.
 Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
 kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
 an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
 though exceptions exist.
 Spirit Seeker
 Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
 world, giving youakinshipwithbeasts. At3rdlevelwhen
 you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
 sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
 as described in chapter 10.
 Totem Spirit
 At3rdlevel, whenyouadoptthispath,youchooseatotem
 spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a
 physical totem object—an amuletorsimilar adornment—
 that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones
 of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain mi
norphysical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem
 spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you
 might be unusually hairy and thickskinned, or if your
 totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
 Your totem animal might be an animal related to those
 listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For
 example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of
 an eagle.
 Bear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage
 except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you
 tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
 Eagle. While you’re raging and aren’t wearing heavy
 armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity
 attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action
 as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle
 makes you into a predator who can weave through the
 fray with ease.
 Wolf. Whileyou’reraging, yourfriends haveadvantage
 onmeleeattackrolls against anycreature within 5feetof
 youthatishostile to you. Thespiritofthewolfmakesyou
 a leader of hunters.
 Aspect of the Beast
 At6thlevel, yougainamagicalbenefitbasedonthetotem
 animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal
 you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
 Bear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying ca
pacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is
 doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks
 made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
 Eagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can
 see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern
 even finedetails as thoughlookingatsomethingnomore
 than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light
 doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Percep
tion) checks.
 Wolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You
 can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
 and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
 pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
 Spirit Walker
 At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature
 spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual
 version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit
 or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the infor
mation you seek.
 36
Totemic Attunement
 At 14thlevel, you gainamagicalbenefitbasedonatotem
 animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal
 you selected previously or a different one.
 Bear. Whileyou’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of
 you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls
 against targets other than you or another character with
 this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t
 see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
 Eagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
 your current walking speed. This benefit works only in
 short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
 nothing else is holding you aloft.
 Wolf. While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action
 on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone
 when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

Bard
 Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient
 monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged
 leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, con
jured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the
 people who constructed the monument and the mythic
 saga it depicts.
 A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically
 against hisscalemail, settingthetempoforhiswarchant
 and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism.
 The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.
 Laughingasshetuneshercittern, agnomeweavesher
 subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that
 her companions’ words will be well received.
 Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves
 magic through words and music to inspire allies, demor
alize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even
 heal wounds.
 Music and Magic
 In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vi
brations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own.
 Thebard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they
 contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into
 existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and
 that echoesoftheseprimordialWordsofCreationstillre
sound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an
 attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly wo
ven into their spells and powers. The greatest strength
 of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to
 stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to in
spire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance.
 But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee
 if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords
 and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illu
sionsratherthanblatantlydestructivespells. Theyhavea
 wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural
 aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards
 become masters of the talents they set their minds to
 perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowl
edge.
 Learning from Experience
 True bards are not common in the world. Not every min
strel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal
 court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in mu
sic requires hard study and some measure of natural
 talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can
 be hard to spot the difference between these perform
ers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wan
dering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and
 living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other
 entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of mu
sical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from
 their fellows. Only rarely do bards settle in one place
 for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new
 tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries be
yondthehorizon—makesanadventuringcareeranatural
 calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, prac
tice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, dis
cover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to
 strange places, or encounterexotic creatures. Bardslove
 to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A
 bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
 experience earns renownamongotherbards. Indeed, af
ter telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing
 mightydeeds,manybardstakethesethemestoheartand
 assume heroic roles themselves.
 Creating a Bard
 Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true
 or not. Your character’s background and motivations are
 not as important as the stories that he or she tells about
 them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane child
hood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you
 might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a
 dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a
 story. Some bards acquire their magical music through
 extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or
 other supernatural creatures.
 Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a
 master, following the more experienced bard until you
 were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you at
tend a college where you studied bardic lore and prac
ticed your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young
 runawayororphan, befriended by a wanderingbardwho
 became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled
 noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled
 into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical
 gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

tions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability

 Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
 Bard Colleges
 The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other
 out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplish
ments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose
 associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their
 gatherings and preserve their traditions.
 College of Lore
 BardsoftheCollegeofLoreknowsomethingaboutmost
 things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as di
verse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether
 singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions
 in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audi
ences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the au
dience members might find themselves questioning ev
erything they heldtobetrue, fromtheirfaithinthepriest
hood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
 The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty
 and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the
 tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
 herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be
 honest than politic.
 The college’s members gather in libraries and some
times in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and
 dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They
 also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can
 expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self
important figures of authority.
 Bonus Proficiencies
 When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain
 proficiency with three skills of your choice.
 Cutting Words
 Alsoat3rdlevel, youlearnhowtouseyourwittodistract,
 confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and compe
tence of others. When a creature that you can see within
 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a
 damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of
 your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspira
tion die and subtracting the number rolled from the crea
ture’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the
 creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines
 whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails,
 or before the creature deals its damage. The creature
 is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being
 40
charmed.
 Additional Magical Secrets
 At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any
 class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast,
 as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen
 spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against
 the number of bard spells you know.
 Peerless Skill
 Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,
 you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a
 Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your
 ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll
 the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
 whether you succeed or fail.
 College of Valor
 Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose
 tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the
 past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes.
 These bards gather in mead halls or around great bon
f
 ires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and
 present. They travel the land to witness great events
 f
 irsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events
 doesn’t pass from the world. With their songs, they in
spire others to reach the same heights of accomplish
ment as the heroes of old.
 Bonus Proficiencies
 When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you
 gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and mar
tial weapons.
 Combat Inspiration
 Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A
 creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can
 roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapondam
age roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is
 made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll
 the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
 its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before
 knowing whether it hits or misses.
 Extra Attack
 Startingat6thlevel, youcanattacktwice,insteadofonce,
 whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 Battle Magic
 At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving spell
casting and weapon use into a single harmonious act.
 When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can
 make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

 Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
 and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
 theyserve, clericsstrivetoembodythehandiworkoftheir
 deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine
 magic.
 Healers and Warriors
 Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the
 gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are con
duits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects.
 The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks
 it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
 Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or train
ing. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient
 rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion
 and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.
 Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and in
spiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
 They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or
 poison, and even call down flames from heaven to con
sumetheir enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit
 most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their
 combat training to let them wade into melee with the
 power of the gods on their side.
 Divine Agents
 Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a
 cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
 service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and
 sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some
 cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as
 a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and in
volving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are
 rare in most hierarchies.
 Whenacleric takes up anadventuring life, it is usually
 because his or her goddemandsit. Pursuingthegoalsof
 the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls
 of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in an
cient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
 their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting ram
paging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations,
 or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to
 enter the world.
 Mostadventuring clerics maintain some connection to
 established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple
 might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a
 position to demand it.
 Creating a Cleric
 As you create a cleric, the most important question to
 consider is which deity to serve and what principles you
 want your character to embody. Appendix B includes
 lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with
 your DMto learn which deities are in your campaign.
 Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s rela
tionship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly?
 Ordidthegodchooseyou,impellingyouintoservicewith
 no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of
 your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker?
 What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a
 special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove
 yourself worthy of a great quest?

tions. First, Wisdomshouldbeyourhighestabilityscore,

 short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
 Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
 As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
 prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
 or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
 saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
 turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
 Aturned creature must spend its turns trying to move
 as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move
 to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reac

 Dodge action.

 Divine Intervention
 Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to in
tervene on your behalf when your need is great.
 Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your ac
tion. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll per
centile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than
 your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses
 the natureoftheintervention; theeffectofanyclericspell
 or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
 If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again
 for 7days. Otherwise,youcanuseitagainafteryoufinish
 a long rest.
 At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds auto
matically, no roll required.
 Divine Domains
 In apantheon, every deity has influence over different as
pects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s do
main. All the domains over which a deity has influence
 are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio
 of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowl
edge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one as
pect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are
 granted powers related to that domain.
 Your choice might correspond to a particular sect ded
icated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be wor
shiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, em
phasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a
 different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasiz
ing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively,
 your choice of domain could simply be a matter of per
sonal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to
 you most.
 Each domain’s description gives examples of deities
 whohave influence over that domain. Gods are included
 from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
 Dragonlance, andEberroncampaignsettings, as well as
 from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons
 of antiquity.
 Knowledge Domain
 The gods of knowledge—including Oghma, Boccob,
 Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth—value learning and under
standing above all. Some teach that knowledge is to
 be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or
 promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention.
 Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to
 themselves. And some promise their followers that they
 will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of
 the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric
 lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of
 the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowl
edge promotethe practical knowledge of craft and inven
tion, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar,
 Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

 If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
 thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its cur
rent emotions and what it is actively thinking about)
 when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1

 learn the same information about that creature.
 Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions of re
cent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street,
 tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going
 back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For
 each minute you meditate, you learn about one signifi
cant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant
 events typically involve powerful emotions, such as bat
tles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and fu
nerals. However, they might also include more mundane

 a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your
 enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving
 throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant dam
age.
 Nature Domain
 Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself,
 from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Sil
vanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly
 deities associated with particular springs and groves
 (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and
 might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious
 rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own
 secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as
 well, champions who take a more active role in advanc
ing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics
 might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the wood
lands, bless theharvestofthefaithful, orwitherthecrops
 of those who anger their gods.

 to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those
 folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them
 to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

 Gods of trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba, Oli

 mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a con
stant challenge to the accepted order among both gods
 and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels,
 gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a
 disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking
 tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flout
ing hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks,
 deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.

lence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch
 over warriors and reward them for their great deeds.

The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring oth
ers to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as
 prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and
 chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as
 well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Eryth
nul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest
 and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet).
 Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take
 a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifes
tations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

 threaten her forest.
 Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the
 form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the
 strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air,
 keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.
 Swingingabladeformedofpurefire, ahalf-elf charges
 into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatu
ral magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking sem
blance of life.
 Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or
 emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are
 an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury.
 They claim no mastery over nature. Instead. they see
 themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.
 Power of Nature
 Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and
 other magical powers either from the force of nature it
self or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic
 spirituality of transcendent unionwithnatureratherthan
 devotion to adivineentity, while others serve godsofwild
 nature, animals, orelementalforces. Theancientdruidic
 traditions are sometimes called the OldFaith, incontrast
 to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.
 Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—
 the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire
 and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on ani
mal forms, and some druids make a particular study of
 this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal
 form to their natural form.
 Preserve the Balance
 For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The
 four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and
 water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were
 to gain power over the others, the world could be de
stroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and bro
ken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids op
posecults ofElementalEvilandotherswhopromoteone
 element to the exclusion of others.
 Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological
 balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need
 for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in op
position to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature,
 and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberra
tions (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead
 (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead
 raids against such creatures, especially when the mon
sters encroach on the druids’ territory.
 Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watch
ing over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a signifi
cant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the
 lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in
 combating the threat, as adventurers.
 Creating a Druid
 When making a druid, consider why your character has
 such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character
 lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was
 raised byadruidafterbeingabandonedinthedepthsofa
 forest. Perhapsyourcharacterhadadramaticencounter
 with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with agiant
 eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe
 your character was born during an epic storm or a vol
canic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that be
coming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.
 Have you always been an adventurer as part of your
 druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker
 of a sacred grove orspring? Perhapsyourhomelandwas
 befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in
 hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

 Cantrips
 At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from
 the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips
 of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
 Knowncolumn of the Druid table.
 Preparing and Casting Spells
 The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to
 cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
 of these druid spells, you must expendaslot of the spell‘s
 level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
 you finish a long rest.
 Youpreparethelistofdruidspellsthatareavailablefor
 you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you
 doso, chooseanumberofdruidspellsequaltoyourWis
dom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell).
 The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
 slots.
 Sacred Plants and Wood
 A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder,
 ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
 willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a
 spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
 sprigs of mistletoe.
 Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
 such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death
 andrebirth, soweaponhandlesforscimitarsorsicklesmight
 be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak
 with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole
 weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.
 Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown
 weapons, such as darts or javelins.
 Druids from regions that lack the plants described here
 have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For in
stance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree
 and cactus plants.
 Forexample, if youarea3rd-1eveldruid, youhavefour
 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of
 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of
 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st
level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it
 from your list of prepared spells.
 You can also change your list of prepared spells when
 you finish alongrest. Preparing a newlist of druid spells
 requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability
 Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells,
 since your magic draws upon your devotion and attune
ment to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell
 refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
 your WisdommodifierwhensettingthesavingthrowDC
 for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll
 with one.
 Spell save DC = 8 +your proficiency bonus + your
 Wisdom modifier
 Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
 Wisdom modifier
 Ritual Casting
 You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
 ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Druid Circle
 Your druid level determines the beasts you can trans
form into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd
 level, for example, you can transform into any beast that
 has a challenge rating of ¼ or lower that doesn’t have a
 f
 lying or swimming speed.

 You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours
 equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then
 revert to your normal form unless you expend another
 use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form
 earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You au
tomatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit
 points, or die.
 While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
 • Yourgamestatisticsarereplacedbythestatisticsofthe
 beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and
 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also
 retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies,
 in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the crea
ture has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in
 its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s
 bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any leg
endary or lair actions, you can’t use them. When you
 transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit
 Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you re
turn to the number of hit points you had before you
 transformed. However, if you revert as a result of drop
ping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
 your normal form. Forexample, if you take 10 damage
 in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you re
vert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage
 doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you
 aren’t knocked unconscious.
 • You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take
 any action that requires hands is limited to the capa
bilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break
 your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, how
ever, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of
 a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.
 • You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
 race, or other source and can usethemifthenewform
 is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t
 use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, un
less your new form also has that sense.
 • Youchoosewhetheryourequipmentfallstotheground
 in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn
 by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the
 DM decides whether it is practical for the new form
 to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s
 shape andsize. Your equipmentdoesn’t change size or
 shape to match the new form, and any equipment that
 the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground
 or mergewithit. Equipmentthatmergeswiththeform
 has no effect until you leave the form.
 At 2ndlevel, youchoosetoidentify withacircle of druids:
 the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both
 detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice
 grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,
 and 14th level.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Timeless Body
 Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield
 causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that
 pass, your body ages only 1 year.
 Beast Spells
 Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid
 spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You
 can perform the somatic and verbal components of a
 druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to
 provide material components.
 Archdruid
 At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited
 number of times.
 Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic
 components of your druid spells, as well as any material
 components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a
 spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape
 and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
 Druid Circles
 Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders,
 druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring
 political borders. All druids are nominally members of
 this druidic society, though some individuals are so iso
lated that they have never seen any high-ranking mem
bers of the society or participated in druidic gatherings.
 Druids recognize each other as brothers an sisters. Like
 creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes
 compete with or even prey on each other.
 At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
 share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the
 way of the druid.
 Circle of the Land
 The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages
 who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a
 vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred cir
cles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets
 in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the
 chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith
 and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a
 member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the
 land whereyouwereinitiated into the circle’s mysterious
 rites.
 51
Bonus Cantrip
 Grassland
 When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one
 additional druid cantrip of your choice.
 Natural Recovery
 Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magi
cal energy by sitting in meditation and communing with
 nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell
 slots to recover. Thespellslotscanhaveacombinedlevel
 that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded
 up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
 can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
 For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can
 recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can re
cover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
 Circle Spells
 Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with
 the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and
 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to
 the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—
 arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp,
 or Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.
 Once yougain access to a circle spell, you always have
 it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
 spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
 spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell
 is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

 Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical diffi

 them and without taking damage from them if they have
 thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
 In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
 against plants that are magically created or manipulated
 to impedemovement,suchthosecreatedbytheentangle

 Nature’s Ward
 When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or
 frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to
 poison and disease.
 Nature’s Sanctuary
 Whenyoureach14thlevel,creaturesofthenaturalworld
 sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to
 attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you,
 that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against
 your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
 must choose a different target, or the attack automati
cally misses. On a successful save, the creature is im
muneto this effect for 24 hours.
 The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its
 attack against you.

Circle of the Moon
 Druids and the Gods
 Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of
 the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to
 share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest
 parts of the wilderness, Where they might go for weeks
 on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
 creature, let alone another druid.
 Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might
 prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as
 aneaglethenextday,andcrashthroughtheundergrowth
 in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild
 is in the druid’s blood.
 Combat wild Shape
 When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the
 ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
 rather than as an action.
 Additionally, whileyouaretransformedbyWildShape,
 you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to
 regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.
 Circle Forms
 The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform
 into moredangerousanimalforms. Startingat2ndlevel,
 you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast
 with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max.
 CRcolumnof the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by
 the other limitations there).
 Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast
 with achallengerating as highasyourdruidleveldivided
 by 3, rounded down.
 Primal Strike
 Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as
 magicalforthepurposeofovercomingresistanceandim
munity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
 Elemental Wild Shape
 At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape
 at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an
 earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.
 Thousand Forms
 By14thlevel, you have learned to use magic to alter your
 physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter
 self spell at will.
 Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but
 most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities
 worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix
 B include many such deities). The worship of these deities
 is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths
 of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of
 Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it
 claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,
 and others who live closely with nature. This tradition in
cludes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond per
sonification, but also encompassestheworshipofBeory, the
 Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna,
 and Ulaa.
 In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,
 druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a sin
gle nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for
 example, mightincludedruidswhorevereSilvanus, Mielikki,
 Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos,
 Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often
 called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most
 druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of
 veneration.
 The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely
 unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of
 the other religions of the world. They believe that every liv
ingthingandeverynaturalphenomenon—sun,moon,wind,
 fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are
 a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
 Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies
 about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other
 and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for exam
ple, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against na
ture, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and
 the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to pro
tect the world from the incursion of aberrations.

 him.
 All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most di
verse class of Characters in the worlds of Dungeons &
 Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
 champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
 and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparal
leled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough
 knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well ac
quainted with death, both meting it out and staring it de
f
 iantly in the face.
 Well-Rounded Specialists
 Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
 f
 ighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
 longswordoragreatsword, useabow,andeventrapfoes
 in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
 adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
 basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
 certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
 someonfightingwithtwoweaponsatonce,andsomeon
 augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combi
nation of broad general ability and extensive specializa
tion makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields
 and in dungeons alike.
 Trained for Danger
 Not every member of the city watch, the village militia,
 or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops
 are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic
 combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
 trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar fig
ures are fighters.
 Somefightersfeeldrawntousetheirtrainingasadven
turers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other
 dangerous work common among adventurers is second
 nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he
 or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but
 also muchgreaterrewards—fewfightersinthecitywatch
 have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue
 sword, for example.
 Creating a Fighter
 As you build your fighter, think about two related ele
ments of your character’s background: Where did you

 the mundane warriors around you? Were you particu
larly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor,
 perhaps because of your exceptional dedication. What
 drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to
 your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove
 yourself might all have been factors.
 You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s
 army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
 academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
 Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
 Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the lim
its of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family
 tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and ar

 you and death’s embrace.

 lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected
 in theBattleMasterarchetype,butthosewhodoarewell
rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.
 Combat Superiority
 When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn
 maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superi
ority dice.
 Maneuvers. You learn three maneuvers of your
 choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below.
 Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You
 can use only one maneuver per attack.
 You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at
 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new ma
neuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know
 with a different one.
 Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice,
 which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you
 use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice
 when you finish a short or long rest.
 You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one
 more at 15th level.
 Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require
 your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneu
ver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as fol
lows:

 Maneuvers
 The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
 Commander’s Strike. When you take the Attack ac
tion on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and
 use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to
 strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who
 can seeorhearyouandexpendonesuperioritydie. That
 creature can immediately use its reaction to make one
 weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack’s
 damage roll.
 Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a
 weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to at
tempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of
 your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority die
 to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a
 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the ob
ject you choose. The object lands at its feet.
 Distracting Strike. When you hit a creature with a
 weaponattack, youcanexpendonesuperioritydietodis
tract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add
 the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The next
 attack roll against the target by an attacker other than
 you has advantage if the attack is made before the start
 of your next turn.
 Evasive Footwork. When you move, you can expend
 onesuperioritydie, rollingthedieandaddingthenumber
 rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
 Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die
 and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing
 one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have
 advantage on your next attack roll against that creature
 this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the
 attack’s damage roll.
 Goading Attack. When you hit a creature with a
 weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to at
tempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the
 superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target
 must makeaWisdomsavingthrow. Onafailed save, the
 target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets
 other than you until the end of your next turn.
 Lunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon at
tack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to
 increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit,
 you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

 Weapon Bond
 At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical
 bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform
 the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
 during a short rest. The weapon must be within your
 reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which
 you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
 Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t

 If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon
 that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to

Monk
 Herfistsablurastheydeflectanincominghailofarrows,
 ahalf-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into
 the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She
 whirlsamongthem,knockingtheirblowsasideandsend
ing them reeling, until at last she stands alone.
 Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos set
tles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach
 him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth,
 engulfing his foes.
 Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad
 halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and
 emergesfromanotherinkyshadowonabalconyastone’s
 throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth
wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window
 at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.
 Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their
 ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their
 bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of com
bat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and
 speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
 The MagicofKi
 Monksmakecareful study of a magical energy that most
 monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of
 the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the
 element that flowsthrough living bodies. Monks harness
 this power within themselves to create magical effects
 and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some
 of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their
 opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny
 speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they
 gain experience, their martial training and their mastery
 of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the
 bodies of their foes.
 Training and Asceticism
 Small walled Cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds
 of D&D,tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where
 time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek
 personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous
 training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent
 to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t
 be found to support them, or in return for some kindness
 that the monks had performed for their families.
 Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding
 population, secluded from anything that might impede
 their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,
 emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the com
mandof their leader, a noble patron, or some other mor
tal or divine power.
 The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors,
 making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and
 exchanging their service for food and other goods. As
 versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their
 neighbors from monsters or tyrants.
 For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving
 a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer.
 This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t un
dertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take
 their work seriously, approaching their adventures as
 personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a
 rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven
 by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely
 slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.
 Creating a Monk
 As you makeyour monkcharacter, think about your con
nection to the monastery where you learned your skills
 and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a
 child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents
 promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service
 performedbythemonks? Didyouenterthissecludedlife
 to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose
 the monastic life for yourself?
 Consider whyyouleft. Did the head of your monastery
 choose you for a particularly important mission beyond
 the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some
 violation of the community’srules. Didyoudreadleaving,
 or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope
 to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to
 return to your home?
 As aresult of the structured life of a monastic commu
nity and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are
 almost always lawful in alignment.

 Martial Arts
 At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mas
tery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk
 weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee
 weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy prop
erty.
 You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed
 or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing
 armor or wielding a shield:
 • YoucanuseDexterityinsteadofStrengthfortheattack
 and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk
 weapons.
 • Youcanrollad4inplaceofthenormaldamageofyour
 unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as
 you gain monklevels, as shown in the Martial Arts col
umnof the Monktable.
 • WhenyouusetheAttackactionwithanunarmedstrike
 or a monkweapononyourturn, youcanmakeoneun
armed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you
 take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff,
 you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus ac
tion, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus ac
tion this turn.
 • Certainmonasteriesusespecializedformsofthemonk
 weapons. For example, you might use a club that is
 twolengths of woodconnectedbyashortchain(called
 a nunchaku) or asickle with a shorter, straighter blade
 (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk
 weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for
 the weapon in chapter 5.
 Ki
 Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness
 the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is rep
resented by a number of ki points. Your monk level de
termines the number of points you have, as shown in the
 Ki Points column of the Monk table.
 You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.
 You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,
 Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more
 ki features as you gain levels in this Class.
 When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you
 f
 inishashortorlongrest,attheendofwhichyoudrawall
 of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend
 at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your
 ki points.
 Some of your ki features require your target to make
 a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving
 throw DC is calculated as follows:
 Ki save DC =8+yourproficiency bonus + your Wisdom
 modifier
 Flurry of Blows
 ImmediatelyafteryoutaketheAttackactiononyourturn,
 you canspend1kipointtomaketwounarmedstrikesas

 Patient Defense
 You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a
 bonus action on your turn.

 action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump dis
tance is doubled for the turn.
 Unarmored Movement
 Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet
 while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
 This bonus increases when you reach certain monk lev
els, as shown in the Monk table.
 At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical
 surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling
 during the move.

Monastic Tradition
 half damage if you fail.
 When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a
 monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way
 of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed
 at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants
 you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th
 level.
 Deflect Missiles
 Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect
 or catch themissile whenyouarehitbyarangedweapon
 attack. Whenyoudoso,thedamageyoutakefromtheat
tack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
 monklevel.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the mis
sile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and
 you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile
 in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged
 attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just
 caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this at
tack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon profi
ciencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for
 the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a
 long range of 60 feet.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Slow Fall
 Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when
 you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an
 amount equal to five times your monk level.
 Extra Attack
 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
 once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 Stunning Strike
 Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of
 ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature
 with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to
 attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a
 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of
 your next turn.
 Ki-Empowered Strikes
 Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as mag
ical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immu
nity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
 Evasion
 At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of
 the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s
 lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are sub
jected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity
 saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
 no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
 Stillness of Mind
 Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one
 effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or
 frightened.
 Purity of Body
 At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you
 makes you immune to disease and poison.
 Tongue of theSunandMoon
 Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other
 minds so that you understand all spoken languages.
 Moreover, any creature that can understand a language
 can understand what you say.
 Diamond Soul

 iciency in all saving throws.
 Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and
 fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the sec
ond result.
 Timeless Body
 At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none
 of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.
 You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no
 longer need food or water.
 Empty Body
 Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend
 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that
 time, you also have resistance to all damage but force
 damage.
 Additionally, youcanspend8kipointstocasttheastral
 projection spell, without needing material components.
 When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with
 you.
 Perfect Self
 At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki
 points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
 Monastic Traditions
 Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in
 the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most
 monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few
 honor the three traditions and instruct each monk ac
cordingtohisorheraptitudeandinterest. Allthreetradi
tions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the
 student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a
 tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
 Way oftheOpenHand
 Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate
 masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or un
armed. They learn techniques to push and trip their op
ponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies,
 and practice advanced meditation that can protect them
 from harm.
 61
Open HandTechnique
 Shadow Step
 Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you
 can manipulate your enemy‘s ki when you harness your
 own. Wheneveryouhitacreaturewithoneoftheattacks
 granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of
 the following effects on that target:
 • It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be
 knocked prone.
 • It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you
 can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
 • It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
 Wholeness of Body
 At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an
 action, you canregainhitpointsequaltothreetimesyour
 monklevel. Youmustfinishalongrestbeforeyoucanuse
 this feature again.
 Tranquility
 Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special medita
tion that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the
 end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell
 that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell
 can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the
 spell equals 8 + your Wisdommodifier+yourproficiency
 bonus.
 Quivering Palm
 At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibra
tions in someone’s body. Whenyouhit acreature with an
 unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these
 imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days
 equaltoyourmonklevel. Thevibrationsareharmlessun
less you use your action to end them. To do so, you and
 the target must be onthe sameplaneofexistence. When
 you use this action, the creature must make a Constitu
tion saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points.
 If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.
 You can have only one creature under the effect of this
 feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations
 harmlessly without using an action.
 Way ofShadow
 Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that val
uesstealth andsubterfuge. Thesemonksmightbecalled
 ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and as
sassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery
 are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy
 about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are
 more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to no
bles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their
 fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these
 monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their
 students.
 Shadow Arts
 Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you
 can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells.
 As anaction, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness,
 darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without pro
viding material components. Additionally, you gain the
 minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.
 At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow
 into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as
 a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoc
cupied space you can seethat is also in dim light or dark
ness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack
 you make before the end of the turn.
 Cloak of Shadows
 By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the
 shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or dark
ness, you can use your action to become invisible. You
 remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or
 are in an area of bright light.
 Opportunist
 At 17thlevel, you can exploit a creature’s momentary dis
traction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature
 within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a crea
ture other than you, you can use your reaction to make a
 melee attack against that creature.
 Way oftheFourElements
 You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to har
ness theelements. Whenyoufocusyourki,youcanalign
 yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four ele
ments to your will, using them as an extension of your
 body. Some members of this tradition dedicate them
selves to a single element, but others weave the elements
 together.
 Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with
 representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined
 as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants,
 mountains, and cresting waves.
 Disciple of the Elements
 When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn
 magical disciplines that harness the power of the four el
ements. Adiscipline requires you to spendkipointseach
 time you use it.
 You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and
 one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are
 detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below.
 You learn one additional elemental discipline of your
 choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
 Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you
 can also replace one elemental discipline that you al
ready know with a different discipline.
 Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disci
plines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the
 general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells,
 you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t
 need to provide material components for it.
 Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend
 additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental
 discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has
 an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands
 does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional
 ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level
 monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning
 hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level
 spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).
 The maximum number of ki points you can spend to
 castaspellinthisway(includingitsbasekipointcostand
 62
any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is
 determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells
 and Ki Points table.

 Clench of the North Wind(6thLevelRequired). You
 can spend 3 ki points to cast hold person.
 Elemental Attunement. You can use your action to
 briefly control elemental forces within 30 feet of you,
 causing one of the following effects of your choice:
 • Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect re
lated to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of
 sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle
 rumbling of stone.
 • Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or
 a small campfire.
 • Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for
 up to 1 hour.
 • Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a
 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you desig

 Eternal Mountain Defense (17th Level Required).
 You can spend 5 ki points to cast stoneskin, targeting
 yourself.
 FangsoftheFireSnake. WhenyouusetheAttackac
tion on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause ten
drils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your
 reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for
 that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such
 an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning dam
age, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it
 also deals an extra 1d10 fire damage.
 Fist of Four Thunders. You can spend 2 ki points to
 cast thunderwave.
 Fist of Unbroken Air. You can create a blast of com
pressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action,
 you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within
 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength sav
ing throw. Onafailed save, the creature takes 3d10 blud
geoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning dam
age for each additional ki point you spend, and you can
 push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock
 it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
 much damage, and you don’t push it or knock it prone.
 Flames of the Phoenix (11th Level Required). You
 can spend 4 ki points to cast fireball.
 Gong of the Summit (6th Level Required). You can
 spend 3 ki points to cast shatter.
 Monastic Orders
 The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries and
 monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural flavor,
 such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms,
 these monasteries are associated with philosophical tradi
tions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the
 Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the South
ern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to
 the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines ofthe monk.
 Someofthesemonasterieshavespreadtothewesternlands
 of Faerun, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant
 communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.
 Othermonastictraditions are associated with deities who
 teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
 In theForgottenRealms,theorderoftheDarkMoonismade

tain secret communitiesinremotehills, backallies, and sub
terranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of en
durance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the
 namesofgreatheroesof thefaith; the Disciples of Saint Sol
lars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery oftheYellow
 Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine
 the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are
 devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host. In the world
 of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of
 meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries
 are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the su
periority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental
 and physical mastery.
 The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world
 of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a
 god but fromdedication to the principles of their nation and
 their race—the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are
 meant to rule the world.

 can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create or fill in a
 trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent
 of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest
 dimension. For example, if you affect a 30-foot square,
 you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower
 the square’s elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to
 15feet deep, and so on. Youcan’t shape the ice to trap or

Paladin
 Creating a Paladin
 Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
 the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down
 her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
 wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands,
 the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
 with amazement.
 A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
 making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an
 orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he
 stalks intotheirmidstandwhispersanoath,andtwoorcs
 are dead before they even realize he is there.
 Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to il
luminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
 spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a
 twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous
 darkness.
 Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
 united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
 Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of
 a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
 beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
 dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful
 bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
 into a blessed champion.
 The Cause ofRighteousness
 Apaladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to
 stand with the good things of the world against the en
croaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wher
ever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various as
pects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by
 the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work.
 Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a
 paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to
 justice itself as it does from a god.
 Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,
 mastering avariety of weaponsandarmor. Evenso,their
 martial skills are secondary to the magical power they
 wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the
 wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and
 those who join them in the fight for justice.
 Beyond the MundaneLife
 Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adven
turing life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her
 away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on
 the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fight
ers are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and
 armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim
 the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the
 call, these warriors turn from their former occupations
 and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths
 lead theminto the service of the crown as leaders of elite
 groupsofknights, but eventhentheirloyalty is first to the
 cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.
 Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A
 delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
 driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of trea
sure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and
 eventhesmallestvictory against it cantilt the cosmicbal
ance away from oblivion.
 The most important aspect of a paladin character is the
 nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class fea
tures related to your oath don’t appear until you reach
 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath
 descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted
 servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor,
 a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite
 evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherish
ing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow,
 a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than
 manyof the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn
 to takevengeanceonthosewhohavedonegreatevil,sent
 as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need
 for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by
 paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr,
 Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver
 Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.
 Howdidyouexperienceyourcalltoserveasapaladin?
 Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel
 while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the
 potential within you and decide to train you as a squire?
 Ordidsometerribleevent—thedestructionofyourhome,
 perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stum
bled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and
 found yourself called to protect all such refuges of good
ness and beauty. Or you might have known from your
 earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling,
 almost as if you had been sent into the world with that
 purpose stamped on your soul.
 As guardians against the forces of wickedness, pal
adins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk
 the paths of charity and justice. Consider howyouralign
ment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the
 manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and
 mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony,
 or your oath might represent standards of behavior that
 you have not yet attained.

Preparing and Casting Spells
 The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
 to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin
 spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the
 spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
 when you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of paladin spells that are avail
able for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell
 list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells
 equal toyourCharismamodifier+halfyourpaladinlevel,
 rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must
 be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have
 four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
 Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
 four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you
 preparethe1st-levelspellcurewounds,youcancastitus
ing a1st-level or a2nd-level slot. Casting thespelldoesn’t
 remove it from your list of prepared spells.
 You can change your list of prepared spells when you
 f
 inish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells
 requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability
 Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
 spells, since their powerderivesfromthestrengthofyour
 convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell
 refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
 your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
 DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an at
tack roll with one.
 Spell save DC = 8 +your proficiency bonus + your
 Charisma modifier
 Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
 Charisma modifier
 Spellcasting Focus
 You canuseaholysymbol(found in chapter 5) as a spell
casting focus for your paladin spells.
 Divine Smite
 Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a
 melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to
 deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the
 weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st
level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than
 1st, to a maximumof5d8. Thedamageincreasesby1d8
 if the target is anundeadorafiend,toamaximumof6d8.
 Divine Health
 By3rdlevel, the divine magic flowing through youmakes
 you immune to disease.
 Sacred Oath
 Whenyou reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds
 you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
 in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet
 sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the
 Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all de
tailed at the end of the class description.
 Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again
 at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath
 spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
 OathSpells
 Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain ac
cess to these spells at the levels specified in the oath de
scription. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you al
ways have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against
 the number of spells you can prepare each day.
 If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the pal
adin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for
 you.
 Channel Divinity
 Youroathallowsyoutochanneldivineenergytofuelmag
ical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by
 your oath explains how to use it.
 WhenyouuseyourChannelDivinity,youchoosewhich
 option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to
 use your Channel Divinity again.
 Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
 When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
 equals your paladin spell save DC.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour

 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
 once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 Aura of Protection
 Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly crea
ture within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the
 creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your
 Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You
 must be conscious to grant this bonus.

 At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

 that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power
 with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee
 weapon, thecreaturetakesanextra1d8radiantdamage.

 one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you
 touch.
 You can use this feature a number of times equal to

Sacred Oaths
 Breaking your Oath
 Becomingapaladininvolvestakingvowsthatcommitthe
 paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of
 f
 ightingwickedness. Thefinaloath,takenwhenheorshe
 reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s
 training. Some characters with this class don’t consider
 themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd
 level and made this oath. For others, the actual swear
ing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what
 has always been true in the paladin’s heart.
 OathofDevotion
 TheOathofDevotionbindsapaladintotheloftiestideals
 of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers,
 white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the
 ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in
 pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold them
selves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for
 better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same
 standards. Manywhoswearthisoatharedevotedtogods
 of lawandgoodandusetheirgods’tenetsasthemeasure
 of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants
 of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of an
gelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.
 Tenets of Devotion
 Thoughtheexact wordsandstrictures of the Oath of De
votion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
 Honesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your
 promise.
 Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
 Compassion. Aidothers,protecttheweak,andpunish
 those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but
 temper it with wisdom.
 Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honor
able deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as
 possible while causing the least amount of harm.
 Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their conse
quences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey
 those who have just authority over you.

 Channel Divinity
 Whenyoutake this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow
ing two Channel Divinity options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one
 weapon that you are holding with positive energy, us
ing your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your
 Charismamodifiertoattackrollsmadewiththatweapon
 (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits

A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct,
 but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes
 the right path proves too demanding, sometimesasituation
 calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of
 emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
 Apaladinwhohasbrokenavowtypicallyseeksabsolution
 from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another
 paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all
night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a
 fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession
 and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
 If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows
 no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more seri
ous. AttheDM’sdiscretion, animpenitentpaladin mightbe
 forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps
 to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the
 Dungeon Master’s Guide.
 yond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it be
comes magical for the duration.
 You can end this effect on your turn as part of any
 other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this
 weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
 Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy
 symbol andspeakaprayercensuring fiends and undead,
 using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that
 can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make
 a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving
 throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
 Aturned creature must spend its turns trying to move
 as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move
 to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reac
tions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
 try to escape from an effect that prevents it from mov
ing. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the
 Dodge action.
 Aura of Devotion
 Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10
 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At
 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
 Purity of Spirit
 Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects
 of a protection from evil and good spell.
 Holy Nimbus
 At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of
 sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a
 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
 Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the
 bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
 In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on
 saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a long rest.
 OathoftheAncients
 TheOathoftheAncientsisasoldastheraceofelvesand
 the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights,
 green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear
 this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the
 68
cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the
 beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessar
ily because they believe in principles of honor, courage,
 and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with
 images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to
 reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in
 the world.
 Tenets of the Ancients
 The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been pre
served for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes
 theprinciplesofgoodaboveanyconcernsoflaworchaos.
 Its four central principles are simple.
 Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kind
ness, andforgiveness, kindlethelight ofhopeinthworld,
 beating back despair.
 Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love,
 and laughter in the world, stand against the wicked
ness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand
 against the forces that would render it barren.
 Preserve YourOwnLight. Delight in song and laugh
ter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your
 own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.
 Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in
 despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth
 in all your deeds.

 Channel Divinity
 Whenyoutake this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow
ing two Channel Divinity options.
 Nature’s Wrath. You can use your Channel Divinity to
 invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action,
 you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for
 a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The
 creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving
 throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by
 the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the
 end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and
 the vines vanish.
 TurntheFaithless. YoucanuseyourChannelDivinity
 to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends
 to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and
 each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you
 must makeaWisdomsavingthrow. Onafailed save, the
 creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
 Aturned creature must spend its turns trying to move
 as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move
 to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reac
tions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
 try to escape from an effect that prevents it from mov
ing. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the
 Dodge action.
 If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,
 shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while
 it is turned.
 Aura of Warding
 Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon
 you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly crea
tures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage
 from spells.
 At18thlevel, therangeofthisauraincreasesto30feet.
 Undying Sentinel
 Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit
 points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop
 to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t
 use it again until you finish a long rest.
 Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old
 age, and you can’t be aged magically.
 Elder Champion
 At20thlevel, youcanassumetheformofanancientforce
 of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For ex
ample, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like
 texture, yourhairmightbecomeleafyormoss-like,oryou
 might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
 Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For
 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
 • At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit
 points.
 • Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting
 time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action
 instead.
 • Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvan
tage on saving throws against your paladin spells and
 Channel Divinity options.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a long rest.
 OathofVengeance
 The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to pun
ish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil
 forces slaughterhelplessvillagers, whenanentirepeople
 turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild
 growstooviolentandpowerful,whenadragonrampages
 through the countryside—at times like these, paladins
 arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that
 which has gone wrong. To these paladins—sometimes
 called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not
 as important as delivering justice.
 Tenets of Vengeance
 The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but
 all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by
 any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets
 are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to
 mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins
 are often neutral orlawfulneutralinalignment. Thecore
 principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
 Fight theGreaterEvil. Faced with a choiceof fighting
 my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the
 greater evil.
 No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win
 mymercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
 69
By AnyMeansNecessary. My qualms can’t get in the
 way of exterminating my foes.

 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you present your holy
 symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your
 Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of
 you that you can see. That creature must make a Wis
dom saving throw, unless it is immune to being fright
ened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this sav
ing throw.
 Onafailedsave, thecreatureisfrightenedfor1minute
 or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the crea
ture’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its
 speed.

 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
 VowofEnmity. Asabonusaction,youcanutteravow

 Relentless Avenger
 By7thlevel, your supernatural focus helps youcloseoffa
 foe’s retreat. Whenyouhitacreaturewithanopportunity
 attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately
 after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This
 movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
 Soul of Vengeance
 Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak
 your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your
 foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of En
mity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make
 ameleeweaponattackagainstthatcreatureif it is within
 range.
 Avenging Angel
 At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic
 avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transforma
tion. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
 • Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying
 speed of 60 feet.
 • You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius.
 The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or
 starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must
 succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become fright
ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

 Creating a Ranger
 Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through
 the shadowsoftrees,huntingtheorcsheknowsareplan
ning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword
 in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting
 down one enemy after another.
 After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf
 f
 inds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow
 at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that
 emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she
 sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between
 the dragon’s thick scales.
 Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
 that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
 side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the
 owlbearhe’sbeentrackingandsendsthehawktodistract

 Farfromthebustleofcitiesandtowns,pastthehedges
 that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of

 andacrosswideandemptyplains, rangerskeeptheirun

 Deadly Hunters
 Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunt
ing the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—
 humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities,
 terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track
 their quarryasapredatordoes,movingstealthilythrough
 the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
 Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that
 are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.
 Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
 acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s
 power, muchasadruiddoes. Theirspells, liketheircom
bat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A
 ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus
 on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
 Independent Adventures
 Thougharangermightmakealivingasahunter,aguide,
 or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the out
skirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and
 humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some
 places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces
 with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are indepen
dent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or
 a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and
 possibly the last—line of defense.
 This fierce independencemakesrangerswellsuitedto
 adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from
 the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with
 city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the
 hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mix
ture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But
 they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry
 their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are
 worthanyextraburden. Coddledcityfolkmightnotknow
 howtofeedthemselvesorfindfreshwaterinthewild,but
 they make up for it in other ways.
 As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
 of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
 Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds
 together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you
 leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—
 perhapsbythesamekindofmonsterthatbecameyourfa
vored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part
 of abandofrangersaffiliatedwithadruidiccircle,trained
 in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be
 self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, track
ing, and even a magical connection to nature through the
 necessity of surviving in the wilds.
 What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain
 kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or
 destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of
 the destruction these monsters cause and commit your
self to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring
 career a continuation of your work in protecting the bor
derlands, orasignificantchange? Whatmadeyoujoinup
 with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to
 teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome
 the relief from solitude that they offer?

 must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 Spellcasting Ability
 Wisdomisyourspellcastingabilityforyourrangerspells,
 since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.
 You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your
 spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom
 modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger
 spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
 Spell save DC = 8 +your proficiency bonus + your
 Wisdom modifier
 Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
 Wisdom modifier
 Ranger Archetype
 At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to
 emulate: HunterorBeastMaster,bothdetailedattheend
 of the class description. Your choice grants you features
 at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
 Primeval Awareness
 Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and ex
pendonerangerspellslottofocusyourawarenessonthe
 region aroundyou. For1minuteperlevelofthespellslot
 you expend, you can sense whether the following types
 of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within
 up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberra
tions, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and un
dead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location
 or number.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Extra Attack
 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
 once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 Land’s Stride
 Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical diffi
cult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also
 pass through nonmagicalplants without being slowedby
 them and without taking damage from them if they have
 thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
 In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
 against plants that are magically created or manipulated
 to impedemovement,suchthosecreatedbytheentangle
 spell.
 Hide in Plain Sight
 Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating
 camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh
 mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring ma
terials with which to create your camouflage.
 Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to
 hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such
 as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you
 are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks
 as long as you remain there without moving or taking ac
tions. Once you moveortakeanaction or areaction, you
 must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
 Vanish
 Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a
 bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by
 nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
 Feral Senses
 At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you
 f
 ight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature
 youcan’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disad
vantageonyourattackrollsagainstit. Youarealsoaware
 of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of
 you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and
 you aren’t blinded or deafened.
 Foe Slayer
 At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your
 enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your
 Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
 an attack you make against one of your favored enemies.
 Youcanchoosetousethisfeature before or after the roll,
 but before any effects of the roll are applied.
 Ranger Archetypes
 The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the
 Hunter and the Beast Master.
 Hunter
 Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your
 place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors
 of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you
 learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you
 face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to tower
ing giants and terrifying dragons.
 Hunter’s Prey
 At 3rdlevel, yougainoneofthefollowingfeaturesofyour
 choice.
 Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the
 mostpotentfoes. Whenyouhitacreaturewithaweapon
 attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s be
low its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra dam
age only once per turn.
 GiantKiller. WhenaLargeorlargercreaturewithin 5
 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use
 73
your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its
 attack, provided that you can see the creature.
 Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when
 you makeaweaponattack, you can make another attack
 with the same weapon against a different creature that
 is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of
 your weapon.
 Defensive Tactics
 At 7thlevel, you gain oneofthefollowing features of your
 choice.
 Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you
 are made with disadvantage.
 Multiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with
 an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subse
quent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the
 turn.
 Steel Will. You have advantage on saving throws
 against being frightened.
 Multiattack
 At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of
 your choice.
 Volley. You can use your action to make a ranged at
tack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of
 a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You
 must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and
 you make a separate attack roll for each target.
 Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make
 a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5
 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
 Superior Hunter’s Defense
 At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of
 your choice.
 Evasion. You can nimbly dodge out of the way of cer
tain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or
 a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an ef
fect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to
 take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you
 succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
 fail.
 Stand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature
 missesyouwithameleeattack,youcanuseyourreaction
 to force that creature to repeat the same attack against
 another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
 Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see
 hits youwithanattack, youcanuseyourreactiontohalve
 the attack’s damage against you.
 Beast Master
 The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship be
tween the civilized races and the beasts of the world.
 United in focus, beast and ranger workasonetofightthe
 monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilder
nessalike. EmulatingtheBeastMasterarchetypemeans
 committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership
 with an animal as its companion and friend.
 Ranger’s Companion
 At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompa
nies you on your adventures and is trained to fight along
side you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium
 and that has a challenge rating of ¼ or lower (Appendix
 D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther
 as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s
 AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any sav
ing throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maxi
mumequalsthehit point number in its stat block or four
 times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any
 creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to re
gain hit points.
 The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It
 takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can
 verbally command the beast where to move (no action
 requiredbyyou). Youcanuseyouractiontoverballycom
mand it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help ac
tion. If you don’t issue a command, the beast takes the
 Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
 youcanmakeoneweaponattackyourselfwhenyoucom
mandthe beast to take the Attack action.
 If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on
 its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast
 never requires your commandtouseitsreaction, suchas
 when making an opportunity attack.
 While traveling through your favored terrain with only
 the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
 If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by
 spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that
 isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.
 Exceptional Training
 Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your
 beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus ac
tion to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage,
 or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast’s attacks
 now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming re
sistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and dam
age.
 Bestial Fury
 Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast
 companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make
 two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has
 that action.
 Share Spells
 Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting
 yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with
 the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

Rogue
 The Rogue
 Sneak
 Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
 forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to
 the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock
 in the blink of an eye. Then shedisappears into the shad
ows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door
 open.
 A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
 accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
 their target, a notorious slaver, passes the alleyway, the
 accomplicecriesout, theslaver comestoinvestigate, and
 the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a
 sound.
 Suppressingagiggle, agnomewagglesherfingersand
 magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a mo
ment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and
 she and her companions are free to make their escape.
 Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabil
ities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have
 a knack for finding the solution to just about any prob
lem, demonstratingaresourcefulnessandversatilitythat
 is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.
 Skill and Precision
 Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a
 variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abil
ities, giving them a broad expertise that few other char
acters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and de
ception, while others refine the skills that help them in a
 dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and dis
arming traps, and opening locks.
 When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
 over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one pre
cise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt
 the target most, than wear an opponent down with a bar
rage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural
 knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks
 to supplement their other abilities.

 As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.

 from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave
 your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards?
 Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some
 other desire or ideal?
 What was the trigger that led you away from your pre
vious life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong
 cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were
 lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you
 needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wander
lust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you
 suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your
 mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or
 maybe you made a new friend—another member of your
 adventuring party—whoshowedyounewpossibilitiesfor
 earning a living and employing your particular talents.
 Quick Build
 You can make a rogue quickly by following these sug
gestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability
 score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to
 excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trick
ster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan
 to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second,
 choose the charlatan background.
 Class Features
 As arogue, you have the following class features.
 Hit Points
 Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level
 Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
 Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8(or5)+yourConstitu
tion modifier per rogue level after 1st

 75

tion, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Percep
tion, Performance, Persuasion, SleightofHand,and

 Equipment
 You start with the following equipment, in addition to the
 equipment granted by your background:
 • (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
 • (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a short
sword
 • (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) and

 At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or
 one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
 thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
 ability check you makethatuseseither ofthechosenpro
f
 iciencies.
 At6thlevel, youcanchoosetwomoreofyourproficien
cies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.
 Sneak Attack
 Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and
 exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an
 extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack
 if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must
 use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
 enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t
 incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the at
tack roll.
 Theamountoftheextradamageincreasesasyougain
 levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column
 of the Rogue table.
 Thieves’ Cant
 During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a
 secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
 hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
 another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands
 such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such
 a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
 In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and
 symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as
 whetheranareaisdangerousortheterritoryofathieves’
 guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in
 an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
 thieves on the run.
 Cunning Action
 Startingat2ndlevel, yourquickthinkingandagilityallow
 you to move andact quickly. You can take a bonus action
 on eachof your turns in combat. This action can be used
 only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
 Roguish Archetype
 At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate
 in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,
 or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class
 description. Your archetype choice grants you features
 at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
 16th, and19thlevel, you canincrease oneability score of
 your choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresof
 your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
 score above 20 using this feature.
 Uncanny Dodge
 Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see
 hits youwithanattack, youcanuseyourreactiontohalve
 the attack’s damage against you.
 Evasion
 Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the
 way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery
 breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to
 aneffectthatallowsyoutomakeaDexteritysavingthrow
 to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if
 you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
 you fail.
 Reliable Talent
 By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
 they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
 check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
 treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
 Blindsense
 Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are
 aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature
 within 10 feet of you.
 Slippery Mind
 By15thlevel, youhaveacquiredgreatermentalstrength.
 You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
 Elusive
 Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers
 rarely gain theupperhandagainstyou. Noattackrollhas
 advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.
 Stroke of Luck
 At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
 when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
 range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
 you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a
 20.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a short or long rest.
 Roguish Archetypes
 Rogues have many features in common, including their
 emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and
 deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
 reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in vary
ing directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your
 choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not nec
76
Infiltration Expertise
 essarily an indication of your chosenprofession, butade
scription of your preferred techniques.
 Thief
 You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars,
 bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow
 this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
 themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
 delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your
 agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
 ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
 magic items you normally couldn’t employ.
 Fast Hands
 Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action
 granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
 (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm
 a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
 Second-Story Work
 Whenyouchoosethisarchetypeat3rdlevel, yougainthe
 ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer
 costs you extra movement.
 In addition, when you make a running jump, the dis
tance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to
 your Dexterity modifier.
 Supreme Sneak
 Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity
 (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed
 on the same turn.
 Use Magic Device
 By 13th level, you have learned enough about the work
ingsofmagicthatyoucanimprovisetheuseofitemseven
 when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class,
 race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.
 Thief’s Reflexes
 Whenyoureach17thlevel,youhavebecomeadeptatlay
ing ambushesandquickly escaping danger. You can take
 two turns during the first round of any combat. You take
 your first turn at your normal initiative and your second
 turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature
 when you are surprised.
 Assassin
 You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those
 who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers,
 spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed
 priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity.
 Stealth, poison, anddisguisehelpyoueliminateyourfoes
 with deadly efficiency.
 Bonus Proficiencies
 When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
 proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner‘s kit.
 Assasinate
 Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you
 get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on
 attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn
 in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
 a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
 Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false iden
tities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp
 to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an
 identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to
 someone else. For example, you might acquire appropri
ate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking
 certification to establish yourself as a member of a trad
ing house from a remote city so you can insinuate your
self into the companyofotherwealthymerchants. There
after, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other
 creatures believe you to be that person until given an ob
vious reason not to.
 Impostor
 At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic an
other person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must
 spend at least three hours studying these three compo
nents of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, exam
ining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.
 Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a
 wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have ad
vantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to
 avoid detection.
 Death Strike
 Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant
 death. When you attack and hit a creature that is sur
prised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 +
 your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a
 failed save, double the damage of your attack against the
 creature.
 Arcane Trickster
 Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth
 and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment
 and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and bur
glars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a signif
icant number of adventurers.
 Spellcasting
 When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast
 spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcast
ing and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
 Cantrips. You learn three cantrips: mage hand and
 two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell
 list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at
 10th level.
 Spell Slots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table
 shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wiz
ard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
 spells, youmustexpendaslotofthespell’slevelorhigher.

 For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm per

Sorcerer
 Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand
 and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As
 an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread
 from her back and she takes to the air.
 Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf
 spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting
 him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges
 up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty
 blast of lightning.
 Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a fin
ger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from
 her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind
 the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild
 magic has turned her skin bright blue.
 Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon
 them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influ
ence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t
 study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than
 one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses
 sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
 RawMagic
 Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind,
 and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.
 Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an an
cientbloodlineinfusedwiththemagicofdragons. Others
 carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic
 storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
 The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpre
dictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one
 sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent
 every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the tal
ents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sor
cerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others
 trace it to strangeeventsintheirownlives. Thetouchofa
 demon,theblessing ofadryadatababy’sbirth, or ataste
 of thewaterfromamysteriousspringmightsparkthegift
 of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, ex
posure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the
 maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner
 workings of reality.
 Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient
 tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely
 onapatrontogranttheirspells as warlocksdo. Bylearn
ing to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they
 can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that
 power.
 Unexplained Powers
 Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find
 a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in
 some way. People with magical power seething in their
 veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay
 quiet. Asorcerer’smagicwantstobewielded,andithasa
 tendencytospill outinunpredictablewaysifitisn’tcalled
 on.
 Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations
 driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater under
standing of the magical force that infuses them, or the
 answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a
 way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. What
ever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an
 adventuring party as wizards, making up for a compara
tive lack of breadthintheirmagicalknowledgewithenor
mous flexibility in using the spells they know.
 Creating a Sorcerer
 The most important question to consider when creating
 your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting
 character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic
 bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact
 source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a fam
ily curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or
 did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with in
herent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
 How do you feel about the magical power coursing
 through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel
 in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse?
 Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the
 optiontorefuseit, anddoyouwishyouhad? Whatdoyou
 intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been
 given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might
 decide that the power gives you the right to do what you
 want, to take what you want from those who lack such
 power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful in
dividual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you
 at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your
 veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the
 deity who chose you to carry this power.

 Sorcerous Origins
 Differentsorcerersclaimdifferentoriginsfortheirinnate
 magic. Although manyvariations exist, most of these ori
gins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and
 wild magic.
 Draconic Bloodline
 Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
 mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most
 often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back
 to amightysorcererofancienttimeswhomadeabargain
 with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon
 parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established
 in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer
 could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact
 or some other exceptional circumstance.
 Dragon Ancestor
 At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your an
cestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is
 used by features you gain later.
 You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
 whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
 with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it ap
plies to the check.
 Draconic Resilience
 As magic flows through your body, it causes physical
 traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level,
 your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases
 by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Ad
ditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen

 of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor,
 your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
 Elemental Affinity
 Startingat6thlevel, whenyoucastaspellthatdealsdam
age of the type associated with your draconic ancestry,
 you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll
 of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery
 point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.
 Dragon Wings
 At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
 dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
 equal to your current speed. You can create these wings
 as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dis
miss them as a bonus action on your turn.
 Youcan’t manifest yourwingswhilewearingarmorun
less the armor is madeto accommodatethem, andcloth
ing not made to accommodate your wings might be de
stroyed when you manifest them.
 Draconic Presence
 Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread pres
ence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you
 to becomeawestruckorfrightened. Asanaction,youcan
 spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude
 an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60
 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration
 (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hos
tile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed
 on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose
 awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.
 Acreature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune
 to your aura for 24 hours.
 Wild Magic
 Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
 that underlie the order of creation. You might have en
dured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
 through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemen
tal Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
 were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a
 demon. Oryourmagiccouldbeaflukeofyourbirth,with
 noapparentcauseorreason. Howeveritcametobe,this
 chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
 Wild Magic Surge
 Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your
 spellcasting can unleash surges of untamedmagic. Once
 per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately
 after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you
 roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a
 random magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too
 wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally
 requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration
 in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
 Tides of Chaos
 Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of
 chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
 ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must
 f
 inish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
 Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the
 DMcanhaveyou roll on the Wild Magic Surge table im
mediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or
 higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
 Bend Luck
 Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate us
ing your wild magic. When another creature you can see
 makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw,
 you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points
 to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or
 penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can do so
 after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll
 occur.
 Controlled Chaos
 At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the
 surgesofyourwildmagic. WheneveryourollontheWild
 MagicSurgetable,youcanrolltwiceanduseeithernum
ber.
 Spell Bombardment
 Beginningat18thlevel, the harmful energyofyourspells
 intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the
 highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one
 of those dice, roll it again and addthatroll to thedamage.
 You can use the feature only once per turn.

Warlock
 Creating a Warlock
 With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf
 in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magicalcharm
 into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel
 to his will.
 Asflamesspringtolife in herhands, awizenedhuman
 whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infus
ing her spell with fiendish magic.
 Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
 odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling
 chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a dis
tant world.
 Warlocksareseekersoftheknowledgethatlieshidden
 in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with
 mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks un
lock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Draw
ing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey no
bles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far
 Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster
 their own power.
 Sworn andBeholden
 A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly be
ing. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and
 patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the be
ings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A
 warlockmightleadacultdedicatedtoademonprince,an
 archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically
 servedbyclerics. Moreoften, though, thearrangementis
 similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The
 warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occa
sional services performed on the patron’s behalf.
 The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor
 but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the
 ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to ac
cess to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, war
locks supplement their magic with some facility at hand
to-hand combat. Theyarecomfortableinlightarmorand
 know howto use simple weapons.
 Delvers into Secrets
 Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
 and power, which compels them into their pacts and
 shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their
 pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
 Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are
 widely known. Butmanywarlocksservepatronsthatare
 not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to
 a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and
 stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And
 sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a
 brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities
 beyond the material world and to the alien beings that
 dwell in the outer void.
 Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge
 and powercan’t be slaked with mere study and research.
 No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or
 she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
 the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active
 pursuit of their goals, whichtypicallymeanssomekindof
 adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons
 drive warlocks toward adventure.
 As you make your warlock character, spend some time
 thinking about your patron and the obligations that your
 pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact,
 and how did you make contact with your patron? Were
 you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out
 the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an
 alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did
 your patron findandchooseyou? Doyouchafeunderthe
 obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of
 the rewards promised to you?
 Work with your DM to determine how big a part your

Pact Boon
 Your Pact Boon
 At3rdlevel, yourotherworldlypatronbestowsagiftupon
 you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following
 features of your choice.
 Pact of the Chain
 You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a rit
ual. Thespelldoesn’tcountagainstyournumberofspells
 known.
 Whenyoucastthespell,youcanchooseoneofthenor
malformsforyourfamiliaroroneofthefollowingspecial
 forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
 Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can
 forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to
 make one attack of its own with its reaction.
 Pact of the Blade
 You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your
 empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee
 weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for
 weapon options). You are proficient with it while you
 wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose
 of overcomingresistanceandimmunitytononmagicalat
tacks and damage.
 Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet
 awayfromyoufor1minuteormore. Italsodisappearsif
 you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no
 action required), or if you die.
 You can transform one magic weapon into your pact
 weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold
 the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of
 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can
 then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimen
sional space, and it appears whenever you create your
 pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a
 sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being
 your pact weaponif you die, if you perform the 1-hour rit
ual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to
 break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if
 it is in theextradimensionalspacewhenthebondbreaks.
 Pact of the Tome
 Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shad
ows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips
 from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the
 same spell list). While the book is on your person, you
 can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against
 your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on
 the warlockspelllist, they are nonethelesswarlockspells
 for you.
 If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a
 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your pa
tron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or
 long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
 turns to ash when you die.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Each Pact Boonoption produces aspecial creature or an ob
ject thal reflects your patron’s nature.
 Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a
 typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your
 patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey
 and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great
 OldOne’snatureis inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable
 for it.
 Pact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your
 weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.
 If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made
 of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your
 patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an
 ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its
 head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
 Pact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a
 fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illu
sion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty
 tomeboundindemonhidestuddedwithiron,holdingspells
 of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sin
ister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could
 be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with
 the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your
 ownburgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
 Mystic Arcanum
 At 11thlevel, yourpatronbestowsuponyouamagicalse
cret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from
 the warlock spell list as this arcanum.
 You can cast your arcanum spell once without expend
ing aspell slot. You mustfinishalongrestbeforeyoucan
 do so again.
 At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your
 choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at
 13th level, one 8th-1evel spell at 15th level, and one 9th
level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic
 Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
 Eldritch Master
 At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mys
tical power while entreating your patron to regain ex
pended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating
 your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots
 fromyourPactMagicfeature. Onceyouregainspellslots
 with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
 can do so again.
 Otherworldly Patrons
 Thebeings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty
 inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but al
most godlike in their power. Various patrons give their
 warlocks access to different powers andinvocations, and
 expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect
 warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely
 or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.
 Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and
 might make apact with only one warlock. Warlocks who
 serve the same patron might view each other as allies,
 siblings, or rivals.
 86
The Archfey
 Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of
 legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the
 mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are
 often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might
 involve a striving for greater magical power or the set
tling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the
 Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of
 the Gleaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her
 consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of
 Fools; and ancient hags.
 Expanded Spell List
 The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of
 spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following
 spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

 the fey. Asanaction, youcancauseeachcreatureina10

 response to harm. When you take damage, you can use
 your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet

 until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast
 a spell.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a short or long rest.
 Beguiling Defenses
 Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to
 turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against
 them. You are immune to being charmed, and when an
other creature attempts to charm you, you can use your
 reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that crea
ture. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
 throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed
 by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any dam
age.
 Dark Delerium
 Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an
 illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you
 canseewithin60feetofyou. ItmustmakeaWisdomsav

 save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for
 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you

 creature takes any damage.
 Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in
 a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The
 creaturecanseeandhearonlyitself,you,andtheillusion.
 You must finish a short or long rest before you can use
 this feature again.
 The Fiend
 You have made apact with a fiend from the lower planes
 of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you
 strive against those aims. Such beings desire the cor
ruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including
 you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include de
mon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu,
 and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater,
 Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are
 especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
 yugoloths.

 any of the roll’s effects occur.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a short or long rest.
 Fiendish Resilience
 Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type
 when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance
 to that damage type until you choose a different one with
 this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver
 weapons ignores this resistance.
 Hurl ThroughHell
 Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an
 attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the
 target throughthelowerplanes. Thecreaturedisappears
 and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
 At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the
 space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
 space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic
 damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
 87
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a long rest.
 The Great OldOne
 Your patron is amysterious entity whose nature is utterly
 foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far
 Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the
 elder gods knownonly in legends. Its motives are incom
prehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense
 and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in com
parison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One
 might be unaware of your existence or entirely indiffer
ent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to
 draw your magic from it.
 Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That
 Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the
 Night Serpent; Zargon, theReturner; GreatCthulhu; and
 other unfathomable beings.

guage with the creature for it to understand your tele
pathic utterances, but the creature must be able to un
derstand at least one language.
 Entropic Ward
 At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against
 attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good
 luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll
 against you, you can use your reaction to impose disad
vantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next
 attackroll againstthecreaturehasadvantageifyoumake
 it before the end of your next turn.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a short or long rest.
 Thought Shield
 Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by
 telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also
 have resistance to psychic damage, and wheneveracrea
ture deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the
 same amount of damage that you do.
 Create Thrall
 At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s
 mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use
 your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That
 creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse

 it, or you use this feature again.

 creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane
 of existence.

Wizard
 Creating a Wizard
 Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf
 closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battle
f
 ield andbeginsherquietchant. Fingersweavinginfront
 of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead
 of firetowardtheenemyranks,whereiteruptsintoacon
f
 lagration that engulfs the soldiers.
 Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
 an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor,
 then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and grace
ful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long
 incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
 bringingawhiffofbrimstonefromtheotherworldlyplane
 beyond.
 Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
 gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
 mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
 them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
 he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
 passage to his left.
 Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
 as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
 weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
 spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
 andbrute-forcemindcontrol. Theirmagicconjuresmon
sters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future,
 or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells
 change one substance into another, call meteors down
 from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
 Scholars of the Arcane
 Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
 power of magic draws students who seek to master its
 mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shap
ing reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell
 requires merely the utterance of a few strange words,
 f
 leeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of ex
otic materials, these surface components barely hint at
 the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and
 countless hours of study.
 Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else
 is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment
 and grow in experience. They can also learn them from
 other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and
 from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped
 in magic.
 The Lure ofKnowledge
 Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wiz
ard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a
 sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others
 the secretsofthemultiverse. Otherwizardsselltheirser
vices as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives
 of crime or domination.
 But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the
 most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their
 libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and
 lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
 in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
 beenlosttotheages, anddiscoveringthosesecretscould
 unlock the path to a power greater than any magic avail
able in the present age.
 Creating a Wizard character demands a backstory dom
inated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your
 character first come into contact with magic? How did
 you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a
 natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice
 incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an
 ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?
 What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your
 f
 irst taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for

 Spellbook
 At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level
 wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repos
itory of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips,
 which are fixed in your mind.
 Preparing and Casting Spells
 The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have
 to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
 one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
 level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
 you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of wizard spells that are avail
able for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wiz
ard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
 modifier +yourwizardlevel (minimumofonespell). The
 spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four
 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelli
gence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six
 spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen
 from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
 magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd
level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your
 list of prepared spells.
 You can change your list of prepared spells when you
 f
 inish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells
 requires time spent studying your spellbook and memo
rizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
 cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
 spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability
 Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
 spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
 studyandmemorization. YouuseyourIntelligencewhen
ever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
 you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the sav
ing throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when mak
ing an attack roll with one.
 Spell save DC = 8 +your proficiency bonus + your
 Intelligence modifier
 Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
 Intelligence modifier
 Ritual Casting
 You cancast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the
 ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You
 don’t need to have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus
 You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
 spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
 Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
 Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wiz
ard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these
 spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots,
 as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you
 mightfindotherspellsthat youcanaddtoyourspellbook
 (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).
 Arcane Recovery
 You have learned to regain some of your magical energy
 by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you fin
ish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to
 recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is
 equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),
 and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
 For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can re
cover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can re
cover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell
 slots.
 Arcane Tradition
 When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradi
tion, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight
 schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchant
ment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmuta
tion, all detailed at the end of the class description.
 91
Your Spellbook
 The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels
 reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well
 as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature
 of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
 adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll
 in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in
 an ancient library.
 Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard
 spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if
 it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the
 time to decipher and copy it.
 Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
 the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique sys
tem of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must
 practice the spell until you understand the sounds or ges
tures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using
 your own notation.
 For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
 costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
 expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
 as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent
 this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your
 other spells.
 Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own
 spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to
 makeabackupcopyofyourspellbook. This is just like copy
ing a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
 since you understand your own notation and already know
 howtocast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp
 for each level of the copied spell.
 If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same proce
dure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a
 new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook
 requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For
 this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe
 place.
 The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique com
pilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and mar
gin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that
 you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt
edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose
 collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your
 previous spellbook in a mishap.
 Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
 at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
 Ability Score Improvement
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
 and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
 choice by2, oryoucanincreasetwoabilityscoresofyour
 choiceby1. Asnormal,youcan’tincreaseanabilityscore
 above 20 using this feature.
 Spell Mastery
 At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over cer
tain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st
level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in
 your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest
 level without expending a spell slot when you have them
 prepared. If you wanttocasteitherspell at ahigherlevel,
 you must expend a spell slot as normal.
 By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
 or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the
 same levels.
 Signature Spells
 When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two
 powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
 Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as
 your signature spells. You always have these spells pre
pared, they don’t count against the number of spells you
 haveprepared, andyoucancasteachofthemonceat3rd
 level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you
 can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If
 you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must
 expend a spell slot as normal.
 Arcane Traditions
 The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the
 earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly estab
lished in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions ded
icated to its complex study.
 The most commonarcane traditions in the multiverse
 revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through
 the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping
 themintoeight categories called schools, as described in
 chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally
 schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion
 while another studies across town at the School of En
chantment. In other institutions, the schools are more
 like academic departments, with rival faculties compet
ing for students and funding. Even wizards who train ap
prentices in the solitude of their own towers use the divi
sion of magic into schools as a learning device, since the
 spells of each school require mastery of different tech
niques.
 School of Abjuration
 The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks,
 banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that
 its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive
 assertion. You understand, however, that ending harm
ful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influ
ences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud
 and respected vocation.
 Called abjurers, members of this school are sought
 when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important
 locations must be guarded against magical spying, and
 whenportalstootherplanesofexistencemustbeclosed.
 Abjuration Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and timeyoumustspendtocopyanabjurationspell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 Arcane Ward
 Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around your
self for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of
 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand
 of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself
 that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit
 points equaltotwiceyourwizardlevel+yourIntelligence
 modifier. Whenever youtakedamage, thewardtakesthe

 Whilethewardhas0hitpoints,itcan’tabsorbdamage,
 but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration
 spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of
 hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
 Onceyoucreatetheward,youcan’tcreateitagainuntil
 you finish a long rest.
 Projected Ward
 Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see
 within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your re
action to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that dam
age. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the
 warded creature takes any remaining damage.
 Improved Abjuration
 Beginningat10thlevel,whenyoucastanabjurationspell
 that requires you to make an ability check as a part of
 casting that spell (as in counterspell and dispel magic),
 you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.
 Spell Resistance
 Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving
 throws against spells.
 Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage
 of spells.
 School of Conjuration
 As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and
 creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing
 clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from else
where to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows,
 you learn spells of transportation and can teleport your
self across vast distances, even to other planes of exis
tence, in an instant.
 Conjuration Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you mustspendtocopyaconjuration spell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 Minor Conjuration
 Starting at 2nd level when youselect this school, you can
 use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your
 hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you
 canseewithin10feetofyou. Thisobjectcanbenolarger
 than 3 feet on a side and weigh nomorethan10pounds,
 andits form mustbethatof anonmagicalobject that you
 have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim
 light out to 5 feet.
 The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this
 feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.
 Benign Transposition
 Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport
 up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
 Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is
 occupied byaSmallorMediumcreature. Ifthatcreature
 is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 youfinishalongrestoryoucastaconjurationspellof1st
 level or higher.
 Focused Conjuration
 Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a
 conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as
 Durable Summons
 Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon
 or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit
 points.
 School of Divination
 The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and com
moners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the
 past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part
 the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you
 can see clearly. You work to master spells of discern
ment,remoteviewing,supernaturalknowledge,andfore
sight.
 Divination Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 Portent
 Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school,
 glimpses of the future begin to press in on your aware
ness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and
 record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack
 roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a crea
ture that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls.
 You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can
 replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
 Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
 f
 inish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
 Expert Divination
 Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so
 easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spell
casting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd
 level or higherusingaspellslot, youregainoneexpended
 spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower
 than the spell you cast and can’t be higher than 5th level.
 The Third Eye
 Starting at 10th level, you can useyouractiontoincrease
 your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one
 of the following benefits, which lasts until you are inca
pacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can’t use
 the feature again until you finish a rest.
 Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60
 feet, as described in chapter 8.
 Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane
 within 60 feet of you.
 GreaterComprehension. Youcanreadanylanguage.
 See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and
 objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
 Greater Portent
 Startingat14thlevel, thevisionsinyourdreamsintensify
 and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what
 is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature,
 rather than two.
 School of Enchantment
 As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have
 honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile
 93
other people and monsters. Someenchantersarepeace
makers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms
 and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are
 tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their ser
vice. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.
 Enchantment Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment
 spell into your spellbook is halved.
 Hypnotic Gaze
 Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your
 soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall
 another creature. As an action, choose one creature that
 you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see
 or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
 against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you
 until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s
 speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and
 visibly dazed.
 Onsubsequent turns, you can use your action to main
tain thiseffect, extendingitsdurationuntiltheendofyour
 next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more
 than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can
 neither see nor hearyou, orif the creature takes damage.
 Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its
 initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this
 feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
 Instinctive Charm
 Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see
 within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you,
 you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided
 that another creature is within the attack’s range. The at
tacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your
 wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must
 target the creature that is closest to it, not including you
 or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker
 chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you
 can’t usethis featureontheattackeragainuntilyoufinish
 a long rest.
 You must choose to use this feature before knowing
 whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t
 be charmed are immune to this effect.
 Split Enchantment
 Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment
 spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature,
 you can have it target a second creature.
 Alter Memories
 At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature un
aware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an
 enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you
 can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains
 unaware of being charmed.
 Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use
 your action to try to make the chosen creature forget
 some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must
 succeedonanIntelligencesavingthrowagainstyourwiz
ard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its mem
ories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum
 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the
 amountoftimecan’texceedthedurationofyourenchant
ment spell.
 School of Evocation
 You focus your study on magic that creates powerful ele
mental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling
 thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some
 evokers find employment in military forces, serving as
 artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
 their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some
 seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring
 tyrants.
 Evocation Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 Sculpt Spells
 Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative
 safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When
 you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures
 that you can see, you canchooseanumberofthemequal
 to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automat
ically succeed on their saving throws against the spell,
 andthey take nodamageiftheywouldnormallytakehalf
 damage on a successful save.
 Potent Cantrip
 Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even
 creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a crea
ture succeeds on asavingthrowagainst your cantrip, the
 creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suf
fers no additional effect from the cantrip.
 Empowered Evocation
 Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence
 modifiertoonedamagerollofanywizardevocationspell
 you cast.
 Overchannel
 Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of
 your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st
 through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maxi
mumdamagewiththat spell.
 The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
 If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest,
 youtake2d12necroticdamageforeachlevelofthespell,
 immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this fea
ture again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic dam
age per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ig
nores resistance and immunity.
 School of Illusion
 You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses,
 befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your
 magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen
 mindmaketheimpossibleseemreal. Someillusionists—
 including many gnome wizards—are benign tricksters
 who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinis
ter masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten
 and fool others for their personal gain.
 94
Illusion Savant
 Grim Harvest
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 Improved Minor Illusion
 When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the
 minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip,
 you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The
 cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips
 known.
 When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a
 sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
 Malleable Illusions
 Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that
 has aduration of 1minuteorlonger, you canuseyourac
tion to change thenatureofthat illusion (using the spell’s
 normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you
 can see the illusion.
 Illusory Self
 Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory dupli
cate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction
 to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against
 you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory
 duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack
 automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
 you finish a short or long rest.
 Illusory Reality
 By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving
 shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi
reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or
 higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical ob
ject that is part of the illusion and make that object real.
 You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the
 spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute.
 For example, you cancreate an illusion of a bridge over a
 chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies
 to cross.
 The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly
 harm anyone.
 School of Necromancy
 The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces
 of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
 this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that an
imates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap
 the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its
 body, transforming that vital energy into magical power
 you can manipulate.
 Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even
 villainous, due to the close association with death. Not
 all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate
 are considered taboo by many societies.
 Necromancy Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 goldandtimeyoumustspendtocopyanecromancyspell
 into your spellbook is halved.
 At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from
 creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when
 you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level
 or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s
 level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the
 School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for
 killing constructs or undead.
 Undead Thralls
 At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your spell
book if it is not there already. When you cast animate
 dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of
 bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropri
ate.
 Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy
 spell, it has additional benefits:
 • The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an
 amount equal to your wizard level.
 • The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its
 weapon damage rolls.
 Inured to Death
 Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic
 damage, and your hit point maximum can’t be reduced.
 You have spent so much time dealing with undead and
 the forces that animate them that you have become in
ured to some of their worst effects.
 CommandUndead
 Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead
 under your control, even those created by other wizards.
 As an action, you can choose one undead that you can
 see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
 Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save
 DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again.
 If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your com
mands until you use this feature again. Intelligent un
deadarehardertocontrolinthisway. If thetargethasan
 Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving
 throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence
 of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end
 of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
 School of Transmutation
 Youareastudentofspellsthatmodifyenergyandmatter.
 To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mu
table, and you delight in being an agent of change. You
 wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both
 physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives
 you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.
 Sometransmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turn
ing people into toads and transforming copper into silver
 for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their mag
ical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power
 of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
 Transmutation Savant
 Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
 gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation
 spell into your spellbook is halved.
 95
Minor Alchemy
 Starting at 2nd level when youselect this school, you can
 temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmag
ical object, changing it from one substance into another.
 You perform a special alchemical procedure on one ob
ject composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gem
stone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a dif
ferent one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you
 spend performing the procedure, you can transform up
 to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you
 lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on
 a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
 Transmuter’s Stone
 Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a
 transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You
 can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another
 creature. Acreaturegainsabenefitofyourchoiceaslong
 as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When you
 create the stone, choose the benefit from the following
 options:
 • Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in
 chapter 8
 • An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is
 unencumbered
 • Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
 • Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
 damage (your choice whenever you choose this bene
f
 it)
 Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level
 or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the
 stone is on your person.
 If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous
 one ceases to function.
 Shapechanger
 At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spell
book, if it is not there already. You can cast polymorph
 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can
 target only yourself and transform into a beast whose
 challenge rating is 1 or lower.
 Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so
 again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can
 still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
 Master Transmuter
 Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to con
sume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within
 your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do
 so, chooseoneofthefollowingeffects. Yourtransmuter’s
 stone is destroyed and can’t be remade until you finish a
 long rest.
 Major Transformation. You can transmute one non
magical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into an
other nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of
 equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes han
dling the object to transform it.
 Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poi
sons affecting a creature that you touch with the trans
muter’s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
 Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a crea
ture you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without ex
pending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your
 spellbook.
 Restore Youth. You touch the transmuter’s stone to a
 willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is re
duced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This
 effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.

Chapter 4: Personality and Background
 C
 haracters are defined by much more than
 their race and class. They’re individuals with
 their own stories, interests, connections, and
 capabilities beyond those that class and race
 define. This chapter expounds on the details
 that distinguish characters from one another, including
 the basics of name and physical description, the rules of
 backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of per
sonality and alignment.
 Character Details
 Your character’s name and physical description might be
 the first things that the other players at the table learn
 about you. It’s worth thinking about how these charac
teristics reflect the character you have in mind.
 Name
 Yourcharacter’s race description includes samplenames
 for members of that race. Put some thought into your
 name even if you’re just picking one from a list.
 Sex
 You can play a male or female character without gain
ing any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
 your character does or does not conform to the broader
 culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behav
ior. For example, amaledrowclericdefiesthetraditional
 genderdivisions of drowsociety, whichcouldbeareason
 for your character to leave that society and come to the
 surface.
 Tika and Artemis: Contrasting Characters
 The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting
 your character apart from every other character. Consider
 the following two human fighters.
 Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a
 brash teenager who had aroughchildhood. The daughter of
 a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s
 trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the
 proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and
 took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But
 when the dragon armies laid waste to the town of Solace
 and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure
 alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her
 skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite
 weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her
 skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
 Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the
 Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility
 to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds
 of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the
 notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the
 city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite
 his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of
 the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to
 recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, con
stantly challenging himself to improve his skills.
 Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters
 (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high
 Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.
 You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of
 sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is of
ten seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for exam
ple, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corel
lon’s image. You could also play a female character who
 presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
 female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
 mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual
 orientation is for you to decide.
 Height and Weight
 You can decide your character’s height and weight, using
 the information provided in your race description or on
 the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what
 your character’s ability scores might say about his or her
 height and weight. A weak but agile character might be
 thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just
 heavy.
 If you want to, you can roll randomly for your char
acter’s height and weight using the Random Height and
 Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modi
f
 ier column determines the character’s extra height (in
 inches) beyond the base height. That same number mul
tiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight
 Modifiercolumndeterminesthecharacter’s extra weight
 (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

 For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8
 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets
 a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then
 the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by
 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra
 36 pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a
 total of 146 pounds.
 OherPhysical Characteristics
 You choose your character’s age and the color of his or
 her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctive
ness, you might want to give your character an unusual
 or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a
 limp, or a tattoo.

Tika and Artemis: Character Details
 Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri
 set these characters apart from each other and reflect their
 personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove
 that she’s not just a kid any more, and her name makes her
 sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an
 exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.
 Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring
 career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freck
les, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man,
 compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and
 high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave.
 His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray
 and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.
 Alignment
 Atypical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons
 has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and
 personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two
 factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral),
 and the other describes attitudes toward society and or
der (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct align
ments define the possible combinations.
 Thesebriefsummariesoftheninealignmentsdescribe
 the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. In
dividuals might vary significantly from that typical behav
ior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful
 to the precepts of their alignment.
 Lawful good(LG) creatures can be counted on to do
 the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, pal
adins, and most dwarves are lawful good.

 wizards are lawful neutral.
 Neutral(N) is the alignment of those who prefer to
 steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, do
ing whatseemsbestatthetime. Lizardfolk, most druids,
 and many humans are neutral.
 Chaotic neutral(CN) creatures follow their whims,
 holding their personal freedom above all else. Many bar

 Neutral evil(NE) is the alignment of those who do
 whatever they can get away with, without compassion or
 qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths
 are neutral evil.
 Chaotic evil(CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence,
 spurredbytheirgreed,hatred,orbloodlust. Demons,red
 dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.
 Alignment in the Multiverse
 For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral
 choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid
 races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or
 evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned
 gods who created these races gave them free will to
 choosetheirmoralpaths,knowingthatgoodwithoutfree
 will is slavery.
 Theevil deities whocreatedotherraces, though, made
 those races to serve them. Those races have strong in
borntendenciesthatmatchthenatureoftheirgods. Most
 orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god, Gru
umsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc
 chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate
 tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lin
gering pull of the orc god’s influence.)
 Alignmentisanessentialpartofthenatureofcelestials
 and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and
 it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful
 evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil,
 it would cease to be a devil.
 Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
 thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned.
 Suchacreatureisincapableofmakingamoralorethical
 choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks
 are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil;
 they have no alignment.
 Tika and Artemis: Alignment
 Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted
 and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is law
ful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at
 least professional in his approach to murder.
 As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer.
 He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with
 heroes when he must—and when it’s in his own best in
terests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems
 in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests
 andobjectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and
 monsters.

 Your race indicates the languages your character can

 Note these languages on your character sheet. Choose
 your languages from the Standard Languages table, or
 choose one that is commonin your campaign. With your
 DM’s permission, you can instead choose a language
 from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language,
 such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids. Some of
 these languages are actually families of languages with
 many dialects. For example, the Primordial language
 includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects,
 one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that

 Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of
 traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give
 a person a unique identity—Will help you bring him or
 her to life as you play the game. Four categories of char
acteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals,
 bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about
 your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and ha
Elvish Script: Sample Alphabet
 Each background presented later in this chapter in
cludes suggested characteristics that you can use to
 spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those op
tions, but they’re a good starting point.
 Personality Traits
 Give your character two personality traits. Personality
 traits are small, simple ways to help you set your char
acter apart from every other character. Your personality
 traits should tell you somethinginteresting andfunabout
 your character. They should be self- descriptions that are
 specific about whatmakesyourcharacterstandout. “I’m
 smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of
 characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells
 you something specific about your character’s interests
 and disposition.
 Personality traits might describe the things your char
acter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your
 character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude
 or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability
 scores.
 Auseful place to start thinking about personality traits
 is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and
 define one trait related to each. Either one could be pos
itive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low
 score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.
 Ideals
 Describeoneidealthatdrivesyourcharacter. Yourideals
 are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fun
damental moral and ethical principles that compel you
 to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your
 life goals to your core belief system.
 Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are
 the principles that you will never betray? What would
 prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act
 and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single
 most important thing you strive for?
 Youcanchooseanyidealsyoulike,butyourcharacter’s
 alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each
 background in this chapter includes six suggested ide
als. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law,
 chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more
 to do with the particular background than with moral or
 ethical perspectives.
 Bonds
 Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a
 character’s connections to people, places, and events in
 the world. They tie you to things from your background.

Flaws
 Tika and Artemis: Personal Characteristics
 Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Way
lan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting
 fromabadfall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is
 always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, pre
cise confidence.
 Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost
 childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance
 of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she
 cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never
 allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly chal
lenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil align
ment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.
 Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The
 inn’s proprietor gave her a new chanceatlife, and her friend
ship with her adventuring companions was forged during
 her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding
 dragon armies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate
 them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as
 “I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragon armies for
 the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.”
 ArtemisEntreri’s bondisastrange, almostparadoxicalre
lationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay and
 grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis
 recognized something of himself in his opponent, some in
dication that if his life had gone differently, he might have
 led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment,
 Artemis is morethanacriminalassassin—heisanantihero,
 driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased
 as“Iwill notrestuntilIhaveprovedmyselfbetterthanDrizzt
 Do’Urden.”
 Each of these characters also has an important flaw.
 Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger
 than her companionsandannoyedthatthey still think of her
 as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be tempted
 to act against her principles if she’s convinced that a partic
ular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis
 Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relation
ship and just wants to be left alone.
 to act against your own best interests if they are threat
ened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a
 character’s motivations and goals.
 Bondsmightansweranyofthesequestions: Whomdo
 you care most about? To what place do you feel a special
 connection? What is your most treasured possession?
 Your bonds might be tied to your class, your back
ground, your race, or some other aspect of your char
acter’s history or personality. You might also gain new
 bonds over the course of your adventures.
 Draconic Script: Sample Alphabet
 Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your char
acter’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or
 weakness—in particular, anything that someone else
 could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act
 against your best interests. More significant than neg
ative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these
 questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person,
 concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your
 vices?
 Inspiraton
 Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to re
ward you for playing your character in a way that’s true
 to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By
 using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait
 of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge
 in negotiating with the BeggarPrince. Orinspirationcan
 let you call on your bond to the defense of your home vil
lage to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid
 on you.
 Gaining Inspiration
 YourDMcanchoosetogiveyouinspirationforavarietyof
 reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your
 personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by
 a flaworbond,andotherwiseportray your character in a
 compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn
 inspiration in the game.
 You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t
 stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.
 Using Inspiration
 If you have inspiration, you can expend it when youmake
 an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending
 your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.
 Additionally, if you haveinspiration, youcanrewardan
other player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or sim
ply doing something exciting in the game. When another
 player character does something that really contributes
 to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up
 your inspiration to give that character inspiration.
 Backgrounds
 Every story has a beginning. Your character’s back
ground reveals where you came from, how you became
 an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter
 might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled sol
dier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan.
 Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or com
manded audiences as a jester.

Tika and Artemis: Backgrounds
 Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest
 years as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid
 didn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin
 background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and
 Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade.
 Artemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving
 him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency
 with the tools of thievery and poison.
 Choosing a background provides you with important
 story cues about your character’s identity. The most im
portant question to ask about your background is what
 changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your back
ground describes and start adventuring? Where did you
 get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you
 come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have
 more money? Howdid you learn the skills of your class?
 Whatsetsyouapartfromordinarypeoplewhoshareyour
 background?
 The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both
 concrete benefits(features, proficiencies, andlanguages)
 and roleplaying suggestions.
 Proficiencies
 Each background gives a character proficiency in two
 skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.
 In addition, most backgrounds give a character profi
ciency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficien
cies are detailed in chapter 5.
 If a character would gain the same proficiency from
 two different sources, he or she can choose a different
 proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.
 Languages
 Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn addi
tional languages beyond those given by race. See “Lan
guages” earlier in this chapter.
 Equipment
 Each background provides a package of starting equip
ment. Ifyouusetheoptionalrulefromchapter5tospend
 coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment
 from your background.
 Suggested Characteristics
 A background contains suggested personal characteris
tics based on your background. You can pick character
istics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the
 suggestionsasinspiration for characteristics of your own
 creation.
 Customising a Background
 You might want to tweak some of the features of a back
ground so it better fits your character or the campaign
 setting. To customize a background, you can replace one
 feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and
 chooseatotal of twotoolproficiencies or languagesfrom
 the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equip
ment package from your background or spend coin on
 gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you
 can’t also take the equipment packagesuggestedforyour
 class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal,
 one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that
 matches your desired background, work with your DM
 to create one.
 Acolyte
 You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a
 specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an interme
diary betweentherealmoftheholyandthemortalworld,
 performingsacredritesandofferingsacrificesinorderto
 conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You
 are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is
 not the same thing as channeling divine power.
 Chooseagod,apantheonofgods,orsomeotherquasi
divine being from among those listed in appendix B or
 those specified by your DM, and work with your DM to
 detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a
 lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to
 assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high
 priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god
 in adifferentway? Perhapsyouweretheleaderofasmall
 cult outside of any established temple structure, or even
 an occult group that served a fiendish master that you
 now deny.
 Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion
 Languages: Two of your choice
 Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you en
tered the priesthood), a prayer bookorprayerwheel,
 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common
 clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
 Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
 As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
 share your faith, and you can perform the religious cer
emonies of your deity. You and your adventuring com
panions can expect to receive free healing and care at
 a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your
 faith, though you must provide any material components
 needed for spells. Those who share your religion will
 support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
 You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated
 to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a resi
dence there. This could be the temple where you used
 to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a tem
ple where you have found a new home. While near your
 temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, pro
vided the assistance you askfor is nothazardousandyou
 remain in good standing with your temple.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or
 other religious communities. Their study of the history
 and tenets of their faith and their relationships to tem
ples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and
 ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or
 heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

 Charlatan
 You have always had a way with people. You know what
 makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts’ desires
 after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few lead
ing questions you canreadthemliketheywerechildren’s
 books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly
 willing to use for your advantage.
 You know what people want and you deliver, or rather,
 you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer peo
ple away from things that sound too good to be true, but
 common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re
 around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure
 that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing more than a
 bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore youth
 and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just hap
pens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible,
 but you make them sound like the real deal.

 Favorite Schemes
 Every charlatan has an angle he or she uses in prefer
ence to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll
 on the table below.
 d6 Scam
 1 I
 cheat at games of chance.
 2 Ishavecoins or forge documents.
 3
 I insinuate myself into people’s lives to prey on their weak
ness and secure their fortunes.
 4 Iputonnewidentities like clothes.
 5 I

 6 Iconvince people that worthless junk is worth their hard
earned money.
 Feature: False Identity
 You have created a second identity that includes docu
mentation,establishedacquaintances,anddisguisesthat
 allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can
 forge documents including official papers and personal
 letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind
 of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their
 true selves behind the masks they construct. They
 reflect what people want to see, what they want to
 believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves
 are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old
 enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

 Feature: By Popular Demand
 You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn
 or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even
 in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodg
ing and food of a modest or comfortable standard (de
pending on the quality of the establishment), as long as
 you perform each night. In addition, your performance
 makes you something of a local figure. When strangers
 recognize you in a town where you have performed, they
 typically take a liking to you.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and
 hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flam
boyant or forceful personalities. They’re inclined toward
 the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about
 the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.

 Variant Entertainer: Gladiator
 A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or
 circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into
 a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy com

 have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By

 Guild Business
 Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to
 support several artisans practicing the same trade.
 However, your guild might instead be a loose network
 of artisans who each work in a different village within
 a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the
 nature of your guild. You can select your guild business
 from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

 Asamemberofyourguild, youknowtheskills needed
 to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in
 your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), as
 well as the principles of trade and good business prac
tices. The question now is whether you abandon your
 trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave
 adventuring and trade together.
 Feature: Guild Membership
 As an established and respected member of a guild, you
 can rely on certain benefits that membership provides.
 Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodg
ing and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if
 needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a
 central place to meet other members of your profession,
 which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, al
lies, or hirelings.
 Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you
 are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a
 goodcasecanbemadeforyourinnocenceorthecrimeis
 justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political
 f
 igures through the guild, if you are a member in good
 standing. Such connections might require the donation
 of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.
 Youmustpayduesof5gppermonthtotheguild. Ifyou
 miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain
 in the guild’s good graces.
 Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in
 the world—until they set down their tools and take up
 an adventuring career. They understand the value of
 hard work and the importance of community, but they’re
 vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

 Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Merchant
 Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a guild
 of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don’t
 craft items yourself but earnalivingbybuyingandselling
 106
the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need
 to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large mer
chant consortium (or family) with interests across the re
gion. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to
 another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or boughtthemfrom
 traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.
 In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to
 adventure far more than the life of an artisan.
 Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might
 be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional lan
guage. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start with
 a mule and acart.
 Hermit
 You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community

 Feature: Discovery
 Thequiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you
 access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact
 nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your
 seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos,
 the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or
 the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else
 has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has
 long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past
 that could rewrite history. It might be information that
 would be damaging to the people who or consigned you
 to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
 Work with your DM to determine the details of your dis
covery and its impact on the campaign.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion,
 whereas others chafe against it and long for company.
 Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the
 solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are
 driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

 d8 Personality Trait
 1
 Noble
 You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry
 a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes,
 and wields significant political influence. You might be
 a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discom
fort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or
 a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense
 of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working
 landowner who cares deeply about the people who live
 and workonyourland, keenly aware of your responsibil
ity to them.
 My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the
 most wonderful and important person in the world.

 4 I take great pains to always look my best and follow the

 I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught

 Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other

 7 My
 Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate
 title and determine how much authority that title carries.
 Anobletitledoesn’tstandonitsown—it’sconnectedtoan
 entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass
 it down to your own children. Not only do you need to
 determine your noble title, but you should also work with
 theDMtodescribeyourfamilyandtheirinfluenceonyou.
 Is yourfamilyoldandestablished,orwasyourtitleonly
 recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield,
 and over what area? What kind of reputation does your
 family have among the other aristocrats of the region?
 Howdothecommonpeople regard them?
 What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to
 the head of the family? Have you already inherited the
 title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are
 you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares
 what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family?
 Howdoes the head of your family feel about your adven
turing career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or
 shunned by the rest of your family?
 Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you
 might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear
 all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your
 line or even a spiritual member of the family?
 These details help establish your family and your title
 as features of the world of the campaign.

 Suggested Characteristics
 Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle
 than most people ever experience, and their personali
ties reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a
 plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other no
bles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to
 the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this re
sponsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

 Whenyouattemptto learn or recall a piece of lore, if you
 donotknowthatinformation, you often know where and
 from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information
 comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage
 or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule
 that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an al
mostinaccessibleplace,orthatitsimplycannotbefound.
 Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can re
quire an adventure or even a whole campaign.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their
 characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to
 scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—
 sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means
 toward other ideals.

 Sailor
 You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time,
 youfaceddownmightystorms,monstersofthedeep,and
 those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless
 depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon,
 but the timehascometotryyourhandatsomethingnew.
 Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed
 with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a
 naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How
 famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still
 sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?
 What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain,
 navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the
 captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good
 terms with your fellows, or on the run?
 Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception
 Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water)
 Equipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a
 lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone
 with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a ran
domtrinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set
 of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10
 gp
 Feature: Ship’s Passage
 Whenyouneedto, youcansecure free passage on a sail
ing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions.
 You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship
 you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by
 a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor,
 you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet
 your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine
 how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return
 for your free passage, you and your companions are ex
pected to assist the crew during the voyage.
 Suggested Characteristics
 Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of
 life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life
 aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most
 110
important attachments.

 If your character has asailor background, youmayselectthis
 background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.
 No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to
 your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you
 can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing
 to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local
 shop, since most people will not report your activity to the
 authorities.
 Soldier
 War has been your life for as long as you care to remem
ber. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons
 and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including
 how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been
 part of a standing national army or a mercenary com
pany, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to
 prominence during a recent war. When you choose this
 background, work with your DMtodeterminewhichmil
itary organization you were a part of, how far through its
 ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you
 had during your military career. Was it a standing army,
 a townguard, oravillage militia? Or it might have been a
 noble’s or merchant’s private army, or a mercenary com
pany.

 Variant Sailor: Pirate
 You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate,
 a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a
 world of sharks and savages. You’ve indulged in larceny
 on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul
 to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to
 you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputa
tion in many a port town.
 Feature: Military Rank
 like)
 You have a military rank from your career as a soldier.
 Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still
 recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to
 you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank
 to exert influenceoverothersoldiers andrequisition sim
ple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also
 usuallygainaccesstofriendlymilitaryencampmentsand
 fortresses where your rank is recognized.
 Suggested Characteristics
 If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy,
 you can choose the Bad Reputation feature (see sidebar)
 instead of the Ships Passage feature.
 The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline
 of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shap
ing their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving
 them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

Chapter 5: Equipment
 T
 he marketplace of a large city teems with
 buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarf
 smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers
 and gnomejewelers, not to mention humans
 of every shape, size, and color drawn from
 a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the
 largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for
 sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker
 baskets and practical swords.
 For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons,
 backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount im
portance, since proper equipment can mean the differ
encebetweenlifeanddeathinadungeonortheuntamed
 wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic mer
chandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the
 face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.
 Starting Equipment
 When you create your character, you receive equipment
 based on a combination of your class and background.
 Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces
 based on your class and spend them on items from the
 lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class
 table to determine how much gold you have to spend.
 You decide how your character came by this starting
 equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods
 that the character purchased during his or her upbring
ing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, ar
mor, and a backpack as part of military service. You
 might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a
 family heirloom, passed down from generation to gener
ation until your character finally took up the mantle and
 followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

 Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins,
 gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and prop
erty can reflect your character’s financial well-being.
 Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for
 what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.
 Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights,
 such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in
 gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by
 the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offer
ingprofessionalservicesforhirecommonlydealincoins.
 Coinage
 Commoncoins come in several different denominations
 based on the relative worth of the metal from which they
 are made. The three most common coins are the gold
 piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
 With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch,
 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not excep
tional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold
 piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if
 the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants
 discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hun
dreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t
 usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather,
 the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the ac
tual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable
 goods.
 One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most
 prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys
 a laborer’s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s
 rest in a poor inn.
 One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are
 common among laborers and beggars. A single copper
 piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
 In addition, unusual coins made of other precious met
als sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum
 piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from
 fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes
 arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transac
tions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a
 platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
 A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so
 f
 ifty coins weigh a pound.

 Selling Treasure
 100 20 10 1
 Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment,
 weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore.
 Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when
 you return to a town or other settlement, provided that
 you can find buyers and merchants interested in your
 loot.
 Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general
 rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment
 fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and
 armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough con
dition to sell.
 Magic Items. Selling magic items is problematic.
 Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too
 113
hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but
 the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few com
monmagicitems,youwon’tnormallycomeacrossmagic
 items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far be
yond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
 Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain
 their full value in the marketplace, and you can either
 trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other
 transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the
 DMmight require you to find a buyer in a large town or
 larger community first.
 Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people con
duct transactions through barter. Like gems and art ob
jects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock,
 and so on—retain their full value in the market and can
 be used as currency.
 Armor andShields
 D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many dif
ferent cultures, each with its own technology level. For
 this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of ar
mor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to
 costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in
 between. The Armor table collects the most commonly
 available types of armor found inthegameandseparates
 them into three categories: light armor, medium armor,
 andheavyarmor. Manywarriorssupplementtheirarmor
 with a shield.
 The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other
 properties of the common types of armor worn in the
 worlds of D&D.
 ArmorProficiency. Anyonecanputonasuitofarmor
 orstrapashieldtoanarm. Onlythoseproficientinthear
mor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your
 class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If
 you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have
 disadvantage onanyability check, saving throw, or attack
 roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast
 spells.
 ArmorClass(AC). Armor protects its wearer from at
tacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your
 base Armor Class.
 Variant: Equipment Sizes
 In mostcampaigns, youcanuseorwearanyequipmentthat
 you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common
 sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a halfling’s
 leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a
 cloud giant’s elegant robe.
 The DMcanimposemorerealism. For example, a suit of
 plate armor made for one human might not fit another one
 without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might
 be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a
 disguise.
 Usingthis variant, whenadventurersfindarmor, clothing,
 andsimilar items that are made to be worn, they might need
 to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert
 to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies
 from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The
 DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in
 cost based on the extent of the alterations required.
 Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the
 wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
 If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the
 Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces
 the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a
 Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
 Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in
 the Stealth column, thewearerhasdisadvantageonDex
terity (Stealth) checks.
 Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is
 carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your
 Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield
 at a time.
 Light Armor
 Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors
 agile adventurers since it offers some protection without
 sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your
 Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor
 type to determine your Armor Class.
 Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of
 cloth and batting.
 Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of
 this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by
 beingboiledinoil. Therestofthearmorismadeofsofter
 and more flexible materials.
 Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible
 leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set riv
ets or spikes.
 Medium Armor
 Medium armor offers more protection than light armor,
 but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium
 armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum
 of +2, to the base number from your armor type to deter
mine your Armor Class.
 Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and
 pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil hu
manoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and
 materials needed to create better armor.
 ChainShirt. Madeofinterlockingmetalrings, a chain
 shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This
 armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper
 body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against
 one another to be muffled by outer layers.
 Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leg
gings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered
 with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of
 a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
 Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal
 chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves
 the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor pro
vides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while
 leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
 Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates
 that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include
 leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached
 with leather straps.

ing a minute to search the battlefield.
 If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property
 to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an im
provised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the
 section). Aslingmustbeloadedtodealanydamagewhen
 used in this way.
 Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse
 weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexter
ity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must
 use the same modifier for both rolls.
 Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack
 rolls withheavyweapons. Aheavyweapon’ssizeandbulk
 make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.
 Light. Alightweaponissmallandeasytohandle,mak
ing it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See
 the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
 Loading. Because of the time required to load this
 weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from
 it whenyouuseanaction,bonusaction,orreactiontofire
 it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally
 make.
 Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged
 attack hasarangeshowninparenthesesaftertheammu
nition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.
 The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the
 second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When
 attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disad
vantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target be
yond the weapon’s long range.
 Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when
 you attack with it, as well as when determining your
 reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9).
 Special. A weapon with the special property has un
usual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s
 description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).
 Thrown. Ifaweaponhasthethrownproperty,youcan
 throwtheweapontomakearangedattack. Iftheweapon
 is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for
 that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a
 melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw
 a handaxe, you use your Strength but if you throw a dag
ger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity,
 since the dagger has the finesse property.
 Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when
 you attack with it.
 Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two
 hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the
 property—the damagewhentheweaponisusedwithtwo
 hands to make a melee attack.
 Improvised Weapons
 Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and
 have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An impro
vised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or
 twohands, suchasbrokenglass, atable leg, a frying pan,
 a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.
 In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an
 actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example,
 atablelegisakintoaclub. AttheDM’soptionacharacter
 proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it
 were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

 1d4 damage(the DMassignsadamagetypeappropriate
 to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to
 makeameleeattack,orthrowsameleeweaponthatdoes
 not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage.
 Animprovised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20
 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
 Silvered Weapons
 Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to
 nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons,
 so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their
 weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or
 ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost repre
sents not only the price of the silver, but the time and ex
pertise needed to add silver to the weapon without mak
ing it less effective.
 Special Weapons
 Weapons with special rules are described here.
 Lance. Youhavedisadvantagewhenyouusealanceto
 attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires
 two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
 Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is re
strained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures
 that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.
 A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength
 check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach
 on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC
 10) also frees the creature withoutharmingit, endingthe
 effect and destroying the net.
 When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to
 attack with a net, you can make only one attack regard
less of the number of attacks you can normally make.
 Adventuring Gear
 This section describes items that have special rules or
 require further explanation.
 Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this
 vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial
 upto20feet,shatteringitonimpact. Ineithercase,make
 a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the
 acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes
 2d6 acid damage.
 Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites
 when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this
 f
 lask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a
 ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the
 alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the
 target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its
 turns. A creature can end this damage by using its ac
tion to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the
 f
 lames.
 Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid
 gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1
 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
 Arcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item—an
 orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand
like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to
 channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock,
 or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus,
 as described in chapter 10.

 creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a
 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
 Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a
 god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a sym
bol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully en
graved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box
 holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix B lists
 the symbols commonlyassociated with many godsinthe
 multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as
 a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10. To use
 the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand,
 wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
 Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents
 of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw
 it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case,
 make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating
 the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is
 a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
 A cleric or paladin may create holy water by perform
ing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform,
 uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the
 caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
 Hunting Trap. Whenyouuseyouraction to set it, this
 trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when
 a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The
 trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object,
 such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A crea
ture that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13
 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and
 stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free
 of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the

 or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats

 Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock,
 grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources
 (such as a mine or a forest).
 Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered
 companies are granted rights to conduct trade along cer
tain routes, to send merchantshipstovariousports, or to
 buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods
 or services that they control, and determine who may
 or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants

 Expenses
 Whennotdescendingintothedepthsoftheearth,explor
ing ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the
 encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane
 realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require ba
sic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing.
 These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost
 more than others.
 Lifestyle Expenses
 Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to ac
count for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover
 your accommodations, food anddrink, and all your other
 necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of
 maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when
 adventure next calls.
 At the start of each week or month (your choice),
 choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the
 price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per
 day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen
 lifestyle over a thirty-day period. multiply the listed price
 by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the
 next, based onthefundsyouhaveatyourdisposal, oryou
 might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your char
acter’s career.
 Yourlifestyle choicecanhaveconsequences. Maintain
ing a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with
 the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attract
ing thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
 criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connec
tions.

 Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no
 place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneak
ing into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the
 good graces of people better off than you. A wretched
 lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease,
 and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
 people covet your armor, weapons, andadventuringgear,
 whichrepresent a fortune by their standards. You are be
neath the notice of most people.
 Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut
 just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house
 in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the ele
ments, but you live in a desperate and often violent envi
ronment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfor
tune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you
 have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle
 level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be
 disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.
 Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the com
forts available in a stable community. Simple food and
 lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable condi
tions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant,
 experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a
 f
 lophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
 benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to
 contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
 lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermon
gers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disrep
utable types.
 Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums
 and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You
 live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding
 house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and
 your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary peo
ple living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families,
 laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards and the like.
 Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means
 that youcanaffordnicerclothingandcaneasilymaintain
 your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle
class neighborhood or in aprivate roomatafineinn. You
 associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and mil
itary officers.
 Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a
 life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the
 social status associated with the old money of nobility
 or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a
 highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the roy
alty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have
 respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good
 part of townoracomfortablesuiteatafineinn. Youlikely
 have a small staff of servants.
 Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You
 move in circles populated by the most powerful people
 in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps
 a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the
 f
 inest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the
 most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants
 attending to your every need. You receive invitations to
 the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend
 evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders,
 high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with
 the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier
 you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into
 political intrigue as a pawn or participant.
 Food, Drink and Lodging

Services
 Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them
 or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most
 suchhirelings havefairly ordinary skills, while others are
 masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with spe
cialized adventuring skills.
 Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on
 the Services table. Other common hirelings include any
 of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town
 or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a spe
cific task. For example, awizardmightpayacarpenterto
 construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica)
 for use in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A fighter
 might commission ablacksmith to forge a special sword.
 A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for
 an upcoming performance in front of the duke.
 Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous ser
vices. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers
 takeonahobgoblinarmyarehirelings,asaresageshired
 to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adven
turer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she
 might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run
 the place, from a castellan or steward to menial labor
ers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy
 a long-term contract that includes a place to live within
 the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.
 Skilled hirelings includeanyonehiredtoperformaser
vice that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool,
 or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The
 pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require
 more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work
 that requires no particular skill and can include laborers,
 porters, maids, and similar workers.

 Spellcasting Services
 People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the cat
egory of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find
 someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or
 favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates
 exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell,
 the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the
 more it costs.
 Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of
 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is
 easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50
 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material com
ponents). Finding someone able and willing to cast a
 higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city,
 perhapsonewithauniversityorprominenttemple. Once
 found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of
 payment, the kind of service that only adventurers can
 provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous
 locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to de
liver something important to a distant settlement.
 Trinkets
 When you make your character, you can roll once on
 the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly
 touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table.
 It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature’s
 pockets.

Chapter 6: Customization Options
 T
 he combination of ability scores, race,
 class, and background defines your charac
ter’s capabilities in the game, and the per
sonal details you create set your charac
ter apart from every other character. Even
 within your class and race, you have options
 to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chap
ter is for players who—with the DM’s permission—want
 to go a step further.
 This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for cus
tomizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Mul
ticlassing lets you combine classes together, and feats
 are special options you can choose instead of increasing
 your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides
 whether these options are available in a campaign.
 Multiclassing
 Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
 classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those
 classes to realize a character concept that might not be
 reflected in one of the standard class options.
 With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level
 in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of
 gainingalevelinyourcurrentclass. Yourlevelsinallyour
 classes are added together to determine your character
 level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and
 two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.
 As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain
 a member of your original class with just a few levels in
 another class, or you might change course entirely, never
 looking back at the class you left behind. You might even
 start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to
 a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice
 some focus in exchange for versatility.
 Prerequisites
 Toqualify for a newclass, youmustmeettheabilityscore
 prerequisites for both your current class and your new
 one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.
 For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into
 the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom
 Multiclassing Example
 Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns
 enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides
 that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to
 progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot
 of time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some
 jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser.
 Gary decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue
 class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and
 1st-level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).
 WhenGary’s character earns enough experience to reach
 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level
 (becomingafighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue level (becom
ing a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps
 dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of mysterious lore
 he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/wizard 1).
 scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a be
ginning character receives, you must be a quick study in
 your newclass, having a natural aptitude that is reflected
 by higher-than-average ability scores.

 Experience Points
 The experience point cost to gain a level is always based
 on your total character level, as shown in the Character
 Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a par
ticular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must
 gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take
 your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a
 cleric.
 Hit Points and Hit Dice
 You gain the hit points from your new class as described
 for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a
 class only when you are a 1st-level character.
 You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
 classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are
 thesamedietype,youcansimplypoolthemtogether. For
 example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so
 if you are apaladin5/fighter5, youhavetend10HitDice.
 If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep
 track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5,
 for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit
 Dice.

 Proficiencies
 Whenyougainalevel in aclass other than your first, you
 gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies, as
 shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.
 Class Features
 Whenyougain anewlevel in a class, you get its features
 for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’ start

 Feats
 A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that
 gives a character special capabilities. It embodies train
ing, experience, and abilities beyond what a class pro
vides.
 At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score
 Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you
 can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice
 instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the
 feat’s description says otherwise.
 You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat
 to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite,
 you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.
 For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a
 Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced
 below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you
 can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is
 restored.

 you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no ben

 bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.
 In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus
 for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect al
lows you to do so, these same rules apply.
 Ability Checks
 An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate
 talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.
 The DM calls for an ability check when a character or
 monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that
 has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
 the dice determine the results.
 Foreveryabilitycheck, theDMdecideswhichofthesix
 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty
 of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more
 difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty
 Classes table shows the most common DCs.
 Typical Difficulty Classes
 Task Difficulty

 Easy
 DC

 30
 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the rel
evant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply
 bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC.
 If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check
 is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at
 hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the charac
ter or monster makes no progress toward the objective
 or makes progress combined with a setback determined
 by the DM.
 Contests
 Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are di
rectly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both
 of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can
 succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring
 that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies
 whenoneofthemistrying to prevent the other one from
 accomplishingagoal—forexample,whenamonstertries
 to force open adoorthatanadventureris holding closed.
 In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a
 special form of ability check, called a contest.
 Both participants in a contest make ability checks ap
propriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate
 bonusesandpenalties, butinsteadofcomparingthetotal
 to a DC,theycomparethetotals of their two checks. The
 participant with the higher check total wins the contest.
 That character or monster either succeeds at the action
 or prevents the other one from succeeding.
 If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the
 same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant
 might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in
 a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character
 grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a
 door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a
 tie means that the door remains shut.
 Skills
 Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, includ
ing skills that a character or a monster can be proficient
 in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score,
 and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a
 focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill pro
f
 iciencies are determined at character creation, and a
 monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat
 block.)
 For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a char
acter’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an
 object, or to stay hidden. EachoftheseaspectsofDexter
ity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand,
 and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has profi
ciency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
 checks related to sneaking and hiding.
 The skills related to each ability score are shown in
 the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)
 See an ability’s description in the later sections of this
 chapterforexamplesofhowtouseaskillassociatedwith
 an ability.
 Strength
 Athletics

 Acrobatics
 Sleight of Hand
 Stealth
 Intelligence
 Arcana
 History

 Persuasion
 Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check us
ing a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Per
ception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the
 DMif proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check.
 In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual
 canaddhisorherproficiencybonustoabilitychecksthat
 involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the in
dividual makes a normal ability check.
 For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dan
gerouscliff, theDungeonMastermightaskforaStrength
 (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Ath
letics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the
 Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency,
 he or she just makes a Strength check.
 Variant: Skills with Different Abilities
 Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a spe
cific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for ex
ample, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situ
ations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply
 to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might
 ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability
 136
and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a
 proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have
 to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your
 DMmightcall for a Constitution check to see if you have
 the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM
 mightallowyoutoapplyyourproficiencyinAthletics and
 ask for aConstitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re profi
cient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the
 Constitution check just as you would normally do for a
 Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc
 barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an
 enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation)
 check, even though Intimidation is normally associated
 with Charisma.
 Passive Checks
 A passive check is a special kind of ability check that
 doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can repre
sent theaverageresultforataskdonerepeatedly, suchas
 searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be
 used when the DMwants to secretly determine whether
 thecharacterssucceedatsomethingwithoutrollingdice,
 such as noticing a hidden monster.
 Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a pas
sive check:
 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
 If the character hasadvantageonthecheck, add5. For
 disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive
 check total as a score.
 For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of
 15andproficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive
 Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.
 The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below
 rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in
 chapter 8.
 Working Together
 Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt
 a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the
 one with the highest ability modifier—can make an abil
ity check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by
 the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help
 action (see chapter 9).
 A character can only provide help if the task is one
 that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying
 to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools,
 so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help an
other character in that task. Moreover, a character can
 help only when two or more individuals working to
gether would actually be productive. Some tasks, such
 as threading a needle, are no easier with help.
 Group Checks
 When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish
 something as agroup, the DMmightaskforagroupabil
ity check. In such a situation, the characters who are
 skilled at a particular taskhelpcoverthosewhoaren’t. To
 makeagroupability check, everyone in the group makes
 the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the
 whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.
 Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re
 most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a
 group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a
 swamp,theDMmightcallforagroupWisdom(Survival)
 check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand,
 sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.
 If at least half the group succeeds, the successful char
acters are able to guide their companions out of danger.
 Otherwise, thegroupstumblesintooneofthesehazards.
 Using Each Ability
 Every task that a character or monster might attempt in
 the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This sec
tionexplainsinmoredetailwhatthoseabilitiesmeanand
 the ways they are used in the game.
 Strength
 Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and
 the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.
 Strength Checks
 AStrengthcheckcanmodelanyattempttolift,push,pull,
 or break something, to force your body through a space,
 or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Ath
letics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength
 checks.
 Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers dif
f
 icult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping,
 or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
 • Youattempttoclimbasheerorslipperycliff, avoidhaz
ards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while
 something is trying to knock you off.
 • Youtry to jump anunusually long distance or pull off a
 stunt midjump.
 • You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur
rents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.
 Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa
ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
 Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for
 a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like
 the following:
 • Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
 • Break free of bonds
 • Push through a tunnel that is too small
 • Hangontoawagonwhile being dragged behind it
 • Tip over a statue
 • Keep aboulder from rolling
 Attack Rolls and Damage
 You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and
 your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon
 such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee
 weaponstomakemeleeattacksinhand-to-hand combat,
 andsomeofthemcanbethrowntomakearangedattack.
 Lifting and Carrying
 Your Strength score determines the amount of weight
 you can bear. The following terms define what you can
 lift or carry.
 Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your
 Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in
 pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that
 most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.
 137
Push,Drag,orLift. Youcanpush,drag,orliftaweight
 in pounds uptotwiceyourcarrying capacity (or 30 times
 your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight
 in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5
 feet.
 Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more
 weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each
 size category above Medium, double the creature’s carry
ing capacity and the amount it can push. drag, or lift. For
 a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
 Variant: Encumbrance
 The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally sim
ple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed
 rules for determining how a character is hindered by the
 weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore
 the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.
 If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength
 score, you are encumbered, which means your speed
 drops by 10 feet.
 If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength
 score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are
 instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed
 drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability
 checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength,
 Dexterity, or Constitution.
 Dexterity
 Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.
 Dexterity Checks
 ADexteritycheckcanmodelanyattempttomovenimbly,
 quickly, orquietly, ortokeepfromfallingontrickyfooting.
 TheAcrobatics,SleightofHand,andStealthskillsreflect
 aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.
 Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers
 yourattempttostayonyourfeetinatrickysituation, such
 as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, bal
ance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s
 deck. TheDMmightalsocallforaDexterity(Acrobatics)
 check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, includ
ing dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
 Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of leg
erdemainormanualtrickery, suchasplantingsomething
 on someoneelseorconcealing an object on your person,
 makeaDexterity(SleightofHand)check. TheDMmight
 also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to deter
minewhetheryoucanliftacoinpurseoffanotherperson
 or slip something out of another person’s pocket.
 Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you
 attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past
 guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on
 someone without being seen or heard.
 OtherDexterityChecks. TheDMmightcallforaDex
terity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the fol
lowing:
 • Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
 • Steer a chariot around a tight turn
 • Pick a lock
 • Disable a trap
 • Securely tie up a prisoner
 • Wriggle free of bonds
 • Play a stringed instrument
 Hiding
 The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for
 hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth)
 check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that
 checks’ total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check
 of any creature that actively searches for signs of your pres
ence.
 Youcan’thidefromacreaturethatcanseeyouclearly, and
 if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking
 over a vase), you give away your position.
 An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to
 hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however,
 and it still has to stay quiet.
 In combat,mostcreaturesstayalertforsignsofdangerall
 around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a crea
ture, it usually sees you. However, under certain circum
stances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hid
den as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing
 you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.
 Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance
 someonewill notice you even if they aren’t searching. To de
termine whether such a creature notices you, the DM com
pares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s pas
sive Wisdom(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the crea
ture’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or
 penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For dis
advantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character
 (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2
 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a pas
sive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
 What Can You See? One of the main factors in determin
ing whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how
 well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily
 obscured, as explained in chapter 8.
 • Craft a small or detailed object
 Attack Rolls and Damage
 You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and
 your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,
 such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dex
terity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
 whenattacking with ameleeweaponthathasthefinesse
 property, such as a dagger or a rapier.
 Armor Class
 Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some
 or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as
 described in chapter 5.
 Initiative
 At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by
 makingaDexteritycheck. Initiativedeterminestheorder
 of creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.
 Constitution
 Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.
 Constitution Checks
 Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply
 to Constitution checks, because the endurance this abil
ity represents is largely passive rather than involving a
 specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A
 Constitution check can model your attempt to push be
yond normal limits, however.
 138
• Communicate with a creature without using words
 The DMmight call for a Constitution check when you
 try to accomplish tasks like the following:
 • Hold your breath
 • March or labor for hours without rest
 • Gowithout sleep
 • Survive without food or water
 • Quaffanentire stein of ale in one go
 Hit Points
 Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points.
 Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit
 Die you roll for your hit points.
 If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point
 maximum changes as well, as though you had the new
 modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your
 Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
 Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you ad
just your hit point maximum as though the modifier had
 always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first
 three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level us
ing your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some ef
fect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your
 Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is re
duced by 7.
 Intelligence
 Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall,
 and the ability to reason.
 Intelligence Checks
 An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to
 draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reason
ing. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Reli
gion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence
 checks.
 Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures
 your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, el
dritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of exis
tence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
 History. Your Intelligence (History) check measures
 your ability to recall lore about historical events, leg
endary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent
 wars, and lost civilizations.
 Investigation. When you look around for clues and
 make deductions based on those clues, you make an In
telligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the lo
cation of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of
 a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the
 weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.
 Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden frag
mentofknowledgemightalsocall for an Intelligence (In
vestigation) check.
 Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures
 your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and ani
mals, the weather, and natural cycles.
 Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures
 your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,
 religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of
 secret cults.
 OtherIntelligence Checks. The DM might call for an
 Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like
 the following:
 • Estimate the value of a precious item
 • Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
 • Forge a document
 • Recall lore about a craft or trade
 • Winagameofskill
 Spellcasting Ability
 Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability,
 which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells
 they cast.
 Wisdom
 Wisdomreflectshowattunedyouaretotheworldaround
 you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.
 Wisdom Checks
 A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body
 language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things
 about the environment, or care for an injured person.
 TheAnimalHandling,Insight,Medicine,Perception,and
 Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kindsofWisdom
 checks.
 Animal Handling. When there is any question
 whetheryoucancalmdownadomesticatedanimal,keep
 a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s in
tentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Han
dling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Han
dling) check to control your mount when you attempt a
 risky maneuver.
 Insight. YourWisdom(Insight)checkdecideswhether
 you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such
 as whensearching out a lie or predicting someone’s next
 move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body lan
guage, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
 Medicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to
 stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.
 Perception. Your Wisdom(Perception) check lets you
 spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of some
thing. It measures your general awareness of your sur
roundings and the keenness of your senses. For exam
ple, you mighttrytohearaconversationthroughaclosed
 door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear mon
sters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to
 spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether
 they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in
 the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed se
cret door.
 Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom
 (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide
 yourgroupthroughfrozenwastelands, identifysignsthat
 owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quick
sand and other natural hazards.
 OtherWisdomChecks. TheDMmightcallforaWis

 Spellcasting Ability
 Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spell
casting ability, which helps determine the saving throw

Finding a Hidden Object
 When your character searches for a hidden object such as a
 secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a
 Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to
 find hidden details or other information and clues that you
 might otherwise overlook.
 In mostcases,youneedtodescribewhereyouarelooking
 in order for the DM to determine your chance of success.
 For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes
 in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you
 pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for
 clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of
 your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to
 specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the
 bureau in order to have any chance of success.

 Charisma
 Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively
 with others. It includes such factors as confidence and
 eloquence, anditcanrepresentacharmingorcommand
ing personality.
 Charisma Checks
 ACharisma check might arise when you try to influence
 or entertain others, when you try to make an impres
sion or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a
 tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Per
formance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in cer
tain kinds of Charisma checks.
 Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check deter
mineswhetheryoucanconvincinglyhidethetruth,either
 verbally or through your actions. This deception can en
compasseverything from misleading others through am
biguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include
 trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money
 through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull
 someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain
 a straight face while telling a blatant lie.
 Intimidation. When you attempt to influence some
one through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical
 violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (In
timidation) check. Examples include trying to pry infor
mation out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back
 down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a bro
ken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a
 decision.
 Performance. Your Charisma (Performance) check
 determines how well you can delight an audience with
 music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of
 entertainment.
 Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone
 or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good na
ture, the DMmightaskyoutomakeaCharisma(Persua
sion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in
 good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests,
 or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading oth
ersincludeconvincingachamberlaintoletyourpartysee
 the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or in
spiring a crowd of townsfolk.
 Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a
 Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like
 the following:
 • Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and
 gossip
 • Blendintoacrowdtogetthesenseofkeytopicsofcon
versation
 Spellcasting Ability
 Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma
 as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the
 saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
 Saving Throws
 A saving throw—also called a save—represents an at
tempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a
 similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a sav
ing throw; youareforcedtomakeonebecauseyourchar
acter or monster is at risk of harm.
 To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appro
priate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dex
terity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
 Asaving throw can be modified by a situational bonus
 or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disad
vantage, as determined by the DM.
 Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
 throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intel
ligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a
 saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency
 bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
 score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies
 as well.
 TheDifficultyClassforasavingthrowisdeterminedby
 the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a sav
ing throw allowed by aspell is determined by the caster’s
 spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
 Theresult of a successful or failed saving throw is also
 detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a suc
cessful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or
 reduced harm, from an effect.

Chapter 8: Adventuring
 D
 elvingintotheancientTombofHorrors,slip
ping through the back alleys of Waterdeep,
 hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles
 on the Isle of Dread—these are the things that
 Dungeons & Dragons adventures are made of.
 Your character in the game might explore for
gotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets
 and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes
 well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards be
fore embarking on a new adventure.
 This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life,
 from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of
 social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this
 chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your
 character might pursue between adventures.
 Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon
 or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game
 follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s
 introduction:
 1. The DMdescribes the environment.
 2. The players describe what they want to do.
 3. The DMnarrates the results of their actions.
 Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the ad
venture, trackingthecharacters’progressastheyexplore
 dungeon corridors or wilderness regions.
 The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe
 what the adventurers find as they enter each new area.
 Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers’ ac
tions determine what happens, so the DM might use a
 timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of
 a map.
 Time
 In situations where keeping track of the passage of time
 is important, theDMdeterminesthetimeataskrequires.
 The DM might use a different time scale depending on
 the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon envi
ronment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale
 of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down
 a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the
 door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to
 search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or
 valuable.
 In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more
 appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower
 at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles
 in just under four hours’ time.
 For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Follow
ing the road fromBaldur’s GatetoWaterdeep, theadven
turersspendfouruneventfuldaysbeforeagoblinambush
 interrupts their journey.
 In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game
 relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in
 chapter 9.
 Movement
 Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dun
geon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all
 sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.
 The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement
 without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You
 travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance
 late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon,
 particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM
 can summarize movement between encounters: “After
 killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwar
ven stronghold. you consult your map, which leads you
 throughmilesofechoingcorridorstoachasmbridgedby
 a narrow stone arch.”
 Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it
 takestogetfromonespottoanother,whethertheanswer
 is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining
 travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel
 pace of thecreatures movingandtheterrain they’re mov
ing over.
 Speed
 Every character and monster has a speed, which is the
 distance in feet that the character or monster can walkin
 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic
 movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.
 The following rules determine how far a character or
 monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
 Travel Pace
 Whiletraveling, agroupofadventurerscanmoveatanor
mal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace ta
ble. The table states how far the party can move in a pe
riod of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast
 pacemakescharacterslessperceptive, whileaslowpace
 makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area
 more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section
 later in this chapter for more information).
 Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that
 characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on
 beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
 For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the
 characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column
 for their pace, and each character must make a Constitu
tion saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 +
 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw,
 a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix
 A).
 Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up
 to an hour), many animals move much faster than hu
manoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for
 about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a
 fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10
 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace,
 but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
 Charactersinwagons,carriages,orotherlandvehicles
 choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne
 vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter
 5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain
 141
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and
 the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up
 to 24 hours per day.
 Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon,
 or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you
 to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide con
tains more information on special methods of travel.

 Difficult Terrain
 Able to use stealth
 The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume
 relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dun
geoncorridors. Butadventurersoftenfacedenseforests,
 deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and
 ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.
 You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1
 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can
 cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour,
 or a day.
 Special Types of Movement
 Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness
 areas often involves more than simply walking. Adven
turers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get
 Where they need to go.
 Climbing, Swimming and Crawling
 While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement
 costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unles a
 creature has a climbing or swimmingspeed. AttheDM’s
 option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with
 few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
 check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water
 might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
 Jumping
 Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
 Long Jump. Whenyou makealong jump, you cover a
 number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at
 least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
 you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
 that distance. Either way, each foot youclearonthejump
 costs a foot of movement.
 This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t
 matter, such asajumpacrossastreamorchasm. Atyour
 DM’soption,youmustsucceedonaDC10Strength(Ath
letics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quar
ter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall.
 Otherwise, you hit it.
 When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed
 on a DC10Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your
 feet. Otherwise, you land prone.
 HighJump. Whenyoumakeahighjump,youleapinto
 the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modi
f
 ier(minimumof0feet)ifyoumoveatleast10feetonfoot
 immediatelybeforethejump. Whenyoumakeastanding
 high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either
 way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of move
ment. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you
 to makeaStrength(Athletics) check to jump higher than
 you normally can.
 You can extend your arms half your height above your
self during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a
 distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times
 your height.
 Activity While Traveling
 As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilder
ness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some
 characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s
 journey.
 Marching Order
 The adventurers should establish a marching order.
 A marching order makes it easier to determine which
 characters are affectedbytraps, whichonescanspothid
den enemies, and which onesarethe closest to those en
emies when a fight breaks out.
 A character might occupy the front rank, one or more
 middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front
 and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side
 with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the
 marching order must change, usually by moving charac
ters to a middle rank.
 FewerThanThreeRanks. Ifanadventuringpartyar
ranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are
 a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s
 considered a front rank.
 Stealth
 While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move
 stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try
 to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.
 See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.
 Noticing Threats
 Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the char
acters to determine whether anyone in the group notices
 a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can
 benoticed only bycharacters in aparticular rank. For ex
ample, asthecharacters are exploring a mazeoftunnels,
 the DM might decide that only those characters in the
 back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy crea
ture following the group, while characters in the front
 and middle ranks cannot. While traveling at a fast pace,
 characterstakea-5penaltytotheirpassiveWisdom(Per
ception) scores to notice hidden threats.
 Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines that
 the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re
 traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens
 next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a con
versation, run away, or wait to see what the other group
 does.
 Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hos
tile creature or group, the DM determines whether the
 adventurers or their foes might be surprised when com
bat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.
 142
Splitting Up the Party
 Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, es
pecially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead.
 You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different
 speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back
 ranks.
 Thedrawbacktothisapproachisthatthepartywillbesplit
 into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The ad
vantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving
 slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier
 characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a
 slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their
 dwarf paladin friend behind.
 Other Activities
 Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the
 group travels are not focused on watching for danger.
 These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom
 (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hid
den threats. However, a character not watching for dan
ger candooneofthefollowingactivitiesinstead, or some
 other activity with the DM’s permission.
 Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group
 from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check
 when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide
 has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)
 Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that
 records the group’s progress and helps the characters
 get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is
 required.
 Track. A character can follow the tracks of another
 creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the
 DMcalls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules
 for tracking.)
 Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready
 sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival)
 check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s
 Guide has rules for foraging.)
 The Environment
 By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places
 that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be
 explored. The rules in this section cover some of the
 most important ways in which adventurers interact with
 the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s
 Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.
 Falling
 Afall from agreat height is one of the mostcommonhaz
ards facing an adventurer.
 At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning
 damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.
 Thecreaturelandsprone, unlessitavoidstakingdamage
 from the fall.
 Suffocating
 A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes
 equalto1+itsConstitutionmodifier(minimumof30sec
onds).
 Whenacreaturerunsoutofbreath, it can survive for a
 numberofroundsequaltoitsConstitutionmodifier(min
imum 1round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0
 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be
 stabilized until it can breathe again.
 For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can
 holdits breathfor3minutes. Ifitstartssuffocating, ithas
 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
 Vision and Light
 The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing
 danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in com
bat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily
 onacharacter’s ability to see. Darkness andothereffects
 that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.
 Agiven area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a
 lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or
 moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wis
dom(Perception) checks that rely on sight.
 A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque
 fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature
 effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see ap
pendix A) when trying to see something in that area.
 The presence or absence of light in an environment
 creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim
 light, and darkness.
 Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even
 gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns,
 f
 ires, and other sources of illumination within a specific
 radius.
 Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly ob
scured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary
 between asourceofbright light, such as a torch, and sur
rounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn
 also counts asdimlight. Aparticularly brilliant full moon
 might bathe the land in dim light.
 Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Charac
ters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit
 nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a sub
terranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
 Blindsight
 Acreature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings
 without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Crea
tures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with
 echolocation or heightened senses, such asbatsandtrue
 dragons, have this sense.
 Darkvision
 Many creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those
 that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a speci
f
 iedrange,acreaturewithdarkvisioncanseeindarkness
 dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it
 were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly ob
scured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the
 creature can’t discern color in that darkness, only shades
 of gray.
 Truesight
 Acreature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see
 in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures
 andobjects, automatically detect visual illusions and suc
ceed on saving throws against them, and perceives the
 original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
 transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can
 see into the Ethereal Plane.
 143
Food andWater
 Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of ex
haustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of
 food or water can’t be removed until the character eats
 and drinks the full required amount.
 Food
 A character needs one pound of food per day and can
 make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eat
ing half a poundoffoodinadaycountsashalfadaywith
out food.
 A character can go without food for a number of days
 equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum
 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character
 automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.
 Anormaldayofeatingresetsthecountofdayswithout
 food to zero.
 Water
 Acharacter needsonegallonofwaterperday, ortwogal
lons per dayif theweatherishot. Acharacterwhodrinks
 only half that much water mustsucceedonaDC15Con
stitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at
 the end of the day. A character with access to even less
 water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the
 end of the day.
 If the character already has one or more levels of ex
haustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
 Interacting with Objects
 Acharacter’s interaction with objects in an environment
 is often simpletoresolveinthegame. Theplayertellsthe
 DMthat his or her character is doing something, such a
 moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything
 happens.
 For example, a character might decide to pull a lever,
 which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to
 f
 loodwithwater, oropenasecretdoorinanearbywall. If
 the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might
 need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call
 for a Strength check to see whether the character can
 wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any
 such check based on the difficulty of the task.
 Characters can also damage objects with their
 weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison
 and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected
 by physical and magical attacks much like creatures
 can. The DM determines an object’s Armor Class and
 hit points, and might decide that certain objects have
 resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s
 hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects
 always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and
 they are immune to effects that require other saves.
 Whenanobject drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.
 AcharactercanalsoattemptaStrengthchecktobreak
 an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.
 Social Interaction
 Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying
 monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less im
portant, though, are the social interactions that adventur
ers have with other inhabitants of the world.
 Interaction takes on many forms. You might need
 to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some
 malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that
 it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any
 characters who are participating in the interaction that
 don’t belongtoanotherplayeratthetable. Anysuchchar
acter is called a nonplayer character (NPC).
 In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is de
scribed as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs
 arepredisposedtohelpyou,andhostileonesareinclined
 to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from
 a friendly NPC, of course.
 Socialinteractionshavetwoprimaryaspects: roleplay
ing and ability checks.
 Roleplaying
 Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In
 this case, it’s you as a player determining how your char
acter thinks, acts, and talks.
 Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, andit
 comestotheforeduringsocialinteractions. Yourcharac
ter’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how
 interactions resolve.
 Therearetwostylesyoucanusewhenroleplayingyour
 character: the descriptive approach and the active ap
proach. Mostplayersuseacombinationofthetwostyles.
 Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.
 Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
 With this approach, you describe your character’s words
 andactions to the DMandtheotherplayers. Drawingon
 your mental image of your character, you tell everyone
 what your character does and how he or she does it.
 Forinstance, Chris plays Tordekthedwarf. Tordekhas
 a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood
 for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf
 minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a con
versation with the dwarf.
 Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult
 at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool
 andglaresattheminstrelbeforeorderinganotherdrink.”
 In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood
 and given the DM a clear idea of his characters attitude
 and actions.
 Whenusingdescriptiveroleplaying, keep the following
 things in mind:
 • Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
 • Focusonyourcharacter’s intent and how others might
 perceive it.
 • Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfort
able with.
 Don’t worry about getting things exactly right, just fo
cus on thinking about what your character would do and
 describing what you see in your mind.
 Active Approach to Roleplaying
 If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow
 players what your character thinks and does, active role
playing shows them.
 When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your
 character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You
 might even echo your character’s movements and body
 144
language. This approach is more immersive than de
scriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe
 things that can’t be reasonably acted out.
 Going backtotheexampleofChrisroleplaying Tordek
 above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used
 active roleplaying:
 Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,
 “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here.
 If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm
 and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then
 adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”
 Results of Roleplaying
 The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to
 determine how anNPCreacts. AcowardlyNPCbuckles
 underthreats of violence. A stubborn dwarfrefusestolet
 anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.
 When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to
 the DM’sportrayal of the NPC’smood, dialogue, andper
sonality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s per
sonality traits, ideals, flaws, andbonds, thenplayonthem
 to influence the NPC’s attitude.
 Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real
 life. If you can offer NPCssomethingtheywant, threaten
 them with something they fear, or play on their sympa
thies andgoals, youcanusewordstogetalmostanything
 you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud war
rior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince
 or deceive will fall short.
 Ability Checks
 In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in deter
mining the outcome of an interaction.
 YourroleplayingeffortscanalteranNPC’sattitude,but
 there might still be an element of chance in the situation.
 For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at
 anypointduringaninteractionifheorshewantsthedice
 to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other
 checksmightbeappropriateincertain situations, at your
 DM’s discretion.
 Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking
 of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the
 deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on
 your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick
 a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is
 proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discus
sion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric
 with Persuasion should do most of the talking.
 Resting
 Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend ev
ery hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social in
teraction, and combat. Theyneedrest—timetosleepand
 eat, tend their wounds, refreshtheirmindsandspiritsfor
 spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.
 Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short
 rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.
 Short Rest
 Ashort rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,
 during which a character does nothing more strenuous
 than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
 Acharacter can spend oneormoreHitDiceattheend
 of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number
 of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For
 each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die
 and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The
 character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum
 of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit
 Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit
 Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.
 Long Rest
 A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8
 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs
 light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch
 for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a
 period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking,
 f
 ighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—
 the characters must begin the rest again to gain any ben
efit from it.
 At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost
 hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up
 to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total
 number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if
 a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four
 spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.
 Acharacter can’t benefit from more than one long rest
 in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1
 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
 Between Adventures
 Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient
 evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and pre
pare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use
 this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms
 and armor, performing research, or spending their hard
earned gold.
 In some cases, the passage of time is something that
 occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a
 new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a cer
tain amountoftimehaspassedandallowyoutodescribe
 in general terms what your character has been doing. At
 other times, the DMmightwanttokeeptrackofjusthow
 much time is passing as events beyond your perception
 stay in motion.
 Lifestyle Expenses
 Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of
 life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as de
scribed in chapter 5.
 Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect
 on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way
 other individuals and groups react to you. For example,
 when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier
 for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live
 in poverty.
 Downtime Activities
 Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your
 character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods
 of downtime canvary in duration, but each downtime ac
tivity requires a certain number of days to complete be
fore you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each
 145
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day
 to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you
 have more than the minimum amount of days to spend,
 you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of
 time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
 Downtime activities other than the ones presented be
low are possible. If you want your character to spend his
 or herdowntimeperforminganactivitynotcoveredhere,
 discuss it with your DM.
 Crafting
 You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring
 equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with
 tools related to the object you are trying to create (typi
cally artisan’s tools). You might also need access to spe
cial materials or locations necessary to create it. For
 example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a
 forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.
 For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can
 craft one or more items with a total market value not ex
ceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth
 half the total marketvalue. Ifsomethingyouwanttocraft
 has amarketvalue greater than 5 gp, you make progress
 every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market
 valueoftheitem. Forexample,asuitofplatearmor(mar
ket value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.
 Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward
 the crafting of a single item, provided that the charac
ters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are
 working together in the same place. Each character con
tributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping
 to craft the item. For example, three characters with
 the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can
 craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of
 750 gp.
 While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle
 without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable
 lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more
 information on lifestyle expenses).
 Practicing a Profession
 You canworkbetweenadventures, allowing you to main
tain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per
 day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle ex
penses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to prac
tice your profession.
 If you are a member of an organization that can pro
vide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’
 guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle
 instead.
 If youhaveproficiencyinthePerformanceskillandput
 your performance skill to use during your downtime, you
 earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
 Recuperating
 You can use downtime between adventures to recover
 from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.
 After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you
 can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a suc
cessful save, you can choose one of the following results:
 • Endoneeffectonyouthatpreventsyoufromregaining
 hit points.
 • Forthenext24hours,gainadvantageonsavingthrows
 against one disease or poison currently affecting you.
 Researching
 The time between adventures is a great chance to per
form research, gaining insight into mysteries that have
 unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can
 include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in
 alibrary or buying drinks for thelocals to pry rumorsand
 gossip from their lips.
 When you begin your research, the DM determines
 whether the information is available, how many days of
 downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are
 any restrictions on your research (such as needing to
 seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The
 DMmight also require you to make one or more ability
 checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to
 f
 ind clues pointing toward the information you seek, or
 a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid.
 Oncethoseconditionsaremet,youlearntheinformation
 if it is available.
 For eachdayofresearch, youmustspend1gptocover
 your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal
 lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).
 Training
 You can spend time between adventures learning a new
 language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might
 allow additional training options.
 First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.
 The DMdetermines how long it takes, and whether one
 or more ability checks are required.
 The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.
 After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
 you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the
 new tool.

 Combat in D&Dcanbechaotic, deadly, and thrilling.
 This chapter provides the rules you needforyourchar
acters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a
 brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on
 a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules ad
dress you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon
 Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer charac
ters involvedincombat,andeachotherplayercontrolsan
 adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or mon
ster that you control.
 The OrderofCombat
 Atypical combat encounter is a clash between two sides,
 a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and
 spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat
 into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents
 about6secondsinthegameworld. Duringaround,each
 participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns
 is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter,
 when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken
 aturn, thefightcontinuestothenextroundifneitherside
 has defeated the other.
 Surprise
 A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp,
 springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous
 cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the
 adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these
 situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the
 other.
 The DM determines who might be surprised. If nei
ther side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice
 each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity
 (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wis
Combat Step by Step
 1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone
 involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
 2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the char
acters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’
 marching order or their stated positions in the room or
 other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries
 are—how far away and in what direction.
 3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat en
counter rolls initiative, determining the order ofcombat
ants’ turns.
 4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
 initiative order.
 5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the
 combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4
 until the fighting stops.
 dom (Perception) score of each creature on the oppos
ing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a
 threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
 If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on
 your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reac
tion until that turn ends. A member of a group can be
 surprised even if the other members aren’t.
 Initiative
 Initiative determines the order of turns during combat.
 When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexter
ity check to determine their place in the initiative order.
 The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical
 creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
 time.
 The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one
 with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the
 lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in
 which they act during each round. The initiative order
 remains the same from round to round.
 If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied
 DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the or
der among their tied characters. The DM can decide the
 order if the tie is between a monster and a player charac
ter. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and
 monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest
 roll going first.
 Your Turn
 Onyour turn, you can move a distance up to your speed
 and take one action. You decide whether to move first
 or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called
 your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.
 The most commonactions you can take are described
 in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter.
 Manyclassfeaturesandotherabilitiesprovideadditional
 options for your action.
 The “Movement and Position” section later in this
 chapter gives the rules for your move.
 You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing any
thing at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on
 your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as
 described in “Actions in Combat.”
 Bonus Actions
 Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you
 take an additional action on your turn called a bonus ac
tion. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a
 roguetotakeabonusaction. Youcantakeabonusaction
 only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the
 gamestatesthatyoucandosomethingasabonusaction.
 You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.
 Youcantakeonlyonebonusactiononyourturn,soyou
 must choose which bonus action to use when you have
 more than one available.
 You choose when to take a bonus action during your
 turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and
 anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions
 also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
 147
Other Activity on Your Turn
 Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require
 neither your action nor your move.
 You can communicate however you are able, through
 brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
 You can also interact with one object or feature of the
 environment for free, during either your move or your ac
tion. For example, you could open a door during your
 move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your
 weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
 If you want to interact with a second object, you need
 to use your action. Some magic items and other special
 objects always require an action to use, as stated in their
 descriptions.
 The DM might require you to use an action for any
 of these activities when it needs special care or when
 it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM
 could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
 stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
 Reactions
 Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you
 to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an
 instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can oc
cur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity
 attack, described later in this chapter, is the most com
montype of reaction.
 When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one
 until the start of your next turn. If the reaction inter
rupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue
 its turn right after the reaction.
 Movement andPosition
 In combat, characters and monsters are in constant mo
tion, oftenusingmovementandpositiontogaintheupper
 hand.
 On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
 Interacting With Objects Around You
 Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in
 tandem with your movement and action:
 • draw or sheathe a sword
 • open or close a door
 • withdraw a potion from your backpack
 • pick up a dropped axe
 • take a bauble from a table
 • remove a ring from your finger
 • stuff some food into your mouth
 • plant a banner in the ground
 • fish a few coins from your belt pouch
 • drink all the ale in a flagon
 • throw a lever or a switch
 • pull a torch from a sconce
 • extinguish a small flame
 • donamask
 • take a book from a shelf you can reach
 • pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
 • put your ear to a door
 • kick a small stone
 • turn a key in a lock
 • tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
 • hand an item to another character
 speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed
 as you like on your turn, following the rules here.
 Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and
 swimming. These different modes of movement can be
 combinedwithwalking,ortheycanconstituteyourentire
 move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance
 of each part of your move from your speed until it is used
 up or until you are done moving.
 The “Special Types of Movement” section in chapter
 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swim
ming.
 Breaking Up Your Move
 You can break up your movement on your turn, using
 some of your speed before and after your action. For ex
ample, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10
 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
 Moving Between Attacks
 If you take anactionthatincludesmorethanoneweapon
 attack, you can break up your movement even further by
 moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter
 who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature
 andwhohasaspeedof25feetcouldmove10feet,make
 an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.
 Using Different Speeds
 If you have more than one speed, such as your walking
 speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth
 between your speeds during your move. Whenever you
 switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from
 the new speed. The result determines how much farther
 you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the
 new speed during the current move.
 For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying
 speed of 60 because a Wizard cast the fly spell on you,
 you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap
 into the air to fly 30 feet more.
 Difficult Terrain
 Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on fea
tureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked
 forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical
 f
 ight contains difficult terrain.
 Everyfootofmovementindifficultterraincosts1extra
 foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space
 count as difficult terrain.
 Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs,
 snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain.
 The space of another creature, whether hostile or not,
 also counts as difficult terrain.
 Being Prone
 Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground,
 either because they are knocked down or because they
 throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a
 condition described in appendix A.
 You can drop prone without using any of your speed.
 Standinguptakesmoreeffort; doingsocostsanamount
 of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if
 your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of move
ment to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have
 enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

 To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic
 such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while
 crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult
 terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
 Moving AroundOtherCreatures
 You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In
 contrast, you canmovethroughahostilecreature’sspace
 only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller
 than you. Rememberthat another creature’s space is dif

 icult terrain for you.
 Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t
 willingly end your move in its space.
 If youleaveahostilecreature’sreachduringyourmove,
 you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in
 the chapter.
 Flying Movement
 Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they
 must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying crea
ture is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is
 otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature
 falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held
 aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
 Creature Size
 Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The
 Size Categories table shows how much space a creature
 of a particular size controls in combat. Objects some
times use the same size categories.
 Space
 Acreature’s spaceistheareainfeetthatiteffectively con
trols in combat, not an expression of its physical dimen
sions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for ex
ample, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium
 hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other crea
tures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

 effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number
 of creatures that can surround another creature in com
bat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can

 Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer
 of them can surround a creature. If four Large crea
tures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s lit
tle room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty
 Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
 Squeezing Into a Smaller Space
 A creature can squeeze through a space that is large
 enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a

 If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures
 or other tokens, follow these rules.
 Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
 Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by
 square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5
foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your
 speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example,
 a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
 If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in
 squares on your character sheet.
 Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have at
 least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diago
nally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal
 movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play.
 The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance on using a
 more realistic approach.)
 If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult
 terrain does, youmusthaveenoughmovementlefttopayfor
 entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of
 movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.
 Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a
 wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.
 Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between
 two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting
 squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop
 counting inthespaceoftheotherone. Countbytheshortest

 5feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature
 mustspend1extrafoot for every foot it moves there, and
 it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving
 throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage
 while it’s in the smaller space.
 Actions in Combat
 When you take your action on your turn, you can take
 one of the actions presented here, an action you gained
 from your class or a special feature, or an action that you
 improvise. Many monsters have action options of their
 own in their stat blocks.
 When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere
 in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is pos
sible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to
 determine success or failure.
 Attack
 The mostcommonactionto take in combat is the Attack
 action, whetheryouareswingingasword,firinganarrow
 from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
 Withthisaction, youmakeonemeleeorrangedattack.
 Seethe“MakinganAttack”sectionfortherulesthatgov
ern attacks.
 Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of
 the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with
 this action.
 Cast a Spell
 Spellcasters such as wizardsandclerics, aswellasmany
 monsters,haveaccesstospellsandcanusethemtogreat
 effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which
 specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reac
tion, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a
 149
spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells
 do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often
 uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See
 chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.
 Dash
 WhenyoutaketheDashaction,yougainextramovement
 for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, af
ter applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for
 example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you
 dash.
 Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this
 additional movement by the same amount. If your speed
 of 30feetisreducedto15feet,forinstance,youcanmove
 up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
 Disengage
 If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t
 provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
 Dodge
 When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on
 avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any at
tack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can
 see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws
 with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapaci
tated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops
 to 0.
 Help
 You can lend your aid to another creature in the comple
tion of a task. When you take the Help action, the crea
ture you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it
 makestoperformthetaskyouarehelpingwith, provided
 that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
 Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attack
ing a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the
 target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s
 attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target be
fore your next turn, the first attack roll is made with ad
vantage.
 Hide
 When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity
 (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules
 in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain
 benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Tar
gets” section later in this chapter.
 Ready
 Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for
 a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you
 cantaketheReadyactiononyourturn,whichletsyouact
 using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
 First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will
 trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you
 will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to
 move up to your speed in response to it. Examples in
clude“Ifthecultist stepsonthetrapdoor, I’llpullthelever
 that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move
 away.”
 Improvising an Action
 Your character can do things not covered by the actions in
 this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating en
emies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling
 for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you

 7 for inspiration as you improvise.
 When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in
 the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible
 and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine
 success or failure.
 Whenthetriggeroccurs, youcaneithertakeyourreac
tion right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
 Rememberthatyoucantakeonlyonereactionperround.
 Whenyouready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold
 its energy, which youreleasewithyourreactionwhenthe
 trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting
 time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic re
quires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your
 concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without tak
ing effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the
 web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends,
 and if you take damage before you release magic missile
 with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.
 Search
 When you take the Search action, you devote your at
tention to finding something. Depending on the nature
 of your search, the DM might have you make a Wis
dom(Perception)checkoranIntelligence(Investigation)
 check.
 Use anObject
 You normally interact with an object while doing some
thing else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an
 attack. When an object requires your action for its use,
 youtaketheUseanObjectaction. Thisactionisalsouse
ful when you want to interact with more than one object
 on your turn.
 Making anAttack
 Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a
 weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a
 spell, an attack has a simple structure.
 1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s
 range: a creature, an object, or a location.
 2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether
 the target has cover and whether you have advantage
 or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells,
 special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties
 or bonuses to your attack roll.
 3. Resolvetheattack. Youmaketheattackroll. Onahit,
 you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules
 that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special ef
fects in addition to or instead of damage.
 If there’s ever any question whether something you’re
 doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re
 making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.
 150
Attack Rolls
 When you make an attack, your attack roll determines
 whethertheattackhitsormisses. Tomakeanattackroll,
 roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total
 of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s
 Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character
 is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a
 monster is in its stat block.
 Modifiers to the Roll
 When a character makes an attack roll, the two most
 common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier
 and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster
 makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is pro
vided in its stat block.
 Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee
 weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used
 for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that
 have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
 Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability
 modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcast
ing ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10.
 Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus
 to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with
 which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack
 with a spell.
 Rolling 1 or 20
 Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing
 the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
 If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits re
gardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. In addition,
 the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chap
ter.
 If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses
 regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.
 Unseen Attackers and Targets
 Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hid
ing, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.
 When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have
 disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether
 you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting
 a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in
 the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the
 DMtypicallyjustsaysthattheattackmissed,notwhether
 you guessed the target’s location correctly.
 Whenacreature can’t see you, you have advantage on
 attack rolls against it.
 If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when
 you make an attack, you give away your location when
 the attack hits or misses.
 Ranged Attacks
 Whenyoumakearangedattack,youfireaboworacross
bow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to
 strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines
 from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged
 attack.
 Range
 You can make ranged attacks only against targets within
 a specified range.
 If a ranged attack, such as one madewithaspell, hasa
 single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.
 Somerangedattacks, such as those made with a long
bow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller num
beristhenormalrange,andthelargernumberisthelong
 range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your tar
get is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target
 beyond the long range.
 Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
 Aimingarangedattackismoredifficultwhenafoeisnext
 to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon,
 a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on
 the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature
 who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.
 Melee Attacks
 Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you
 to attack a foe within your reach. Ameleeattacktypically
 uses a handheld weaponsuchasasword,awarhammer,
 or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when
 it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other
 body part. A few spells also involve making a melee at
tack.
 Mostcreatureshavea5-footreachandcanthusattack
 targetswithin5feetofthemwhenmakingameleeattack.
 Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium)
 have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as
 noted in their descriptions.
 Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon
 attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick,
 head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count
 asweapons). Onahit,anunarmedstrikedealsbludgeon
ing damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are
 proficient with your unarmed strikes.
 Opportunity Attacks
 In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies
 to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past
 yourfoeswithoutputtingyourselfindanger; doingsopro
vokes an opportunity attack.
 You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile
 creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To
 make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to
 make one melee attack against the provoking creature.
 The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s move
ment, occurring right before the creature leaves your
 reach.
 You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by tak
ing the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an op
portunity attack when you teleport or when someone or
 something moves you without using your movement, ac
tion, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an op
portunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s
 reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
 Two-Weapon Fighting
 When you take the Attack action and attack with a light
 melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can
 use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee
 weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t
 add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus at
tack, unless that modifier is negative.

Contests in Combat
 Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of
 your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This
 section includes the most common contests that require an
 action incombat: grapplingandshovingacreature. TheDM
 can use these contests as models for improvising others.
 If either weapon has the thrown property, you can
 throwtheweapon,insteadofmakingameleeattackwith
 it.
 Grappling
 Whenyouwantto grab a creature or wrestle with it, you
 can usetheAttack action to make aspecial melee attack,
 agrapple. If you’re able to makemultipleattackswiththe
 Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
 The target of your grapple must be no more than one
 size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
 Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target
 by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check
 contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
 (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
 You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.
 If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled
 condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the
 things that end it, and you can release the target when
ever you like (no action required).
 Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its
 action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
 (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by
 your Strength (Athletics) check.
 Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you

 smaller than you.
 Shoving a Creature
 UsingtheAttackaction, youcanmakeaspecialmeleeat

 it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks
 with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
 Thetargetofyourshovemustbenomorethanonesize

 make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the tar

 (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed au
tomatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed,
 you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away
 from you.
 Cover
 Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide
 cover during combat, making a target more difficult to
 harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an at
tack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the
 cover.
 There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind
 multiplesourcesofcover, onlythemostprotectivedegree
 of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For
 example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half
 cover andatreetrunkthatgives three-quarters cover, the
 target has three-quarters cover.
 Atarget with halfcover hasa+2bonustoACandDex
terity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle
 blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a
 lowwall,alargepieceoffurniture,anarrowtreetrunk,or
 a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or afriend.
 A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus
 to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three
quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by
 an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow
 slit, or a thick tree trunk.
 A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by
 an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such
 a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has
 total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
 Damage andHealing
 Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of
 those who explore the worlds of D&D. The thrust of a
 sword, awell-placed arrow, or a blast of flame fromafire
ball spell all havethepotentialtodamage,orevenkill, the
 hardiest of creatures.
 Hit Points
 Hit points represent a combination of physical and men
tal durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with
 more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with
 fewer hit points are more fragile.
 A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit
 points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point
 maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently
 as a creature takes damage or receives healing.
 Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is
 subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has
 no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature
 drops to 0 hit points.
 Damage Rolls
 Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability speci
f
 ies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice,
 add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target.
 Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can
 grant a bonus to damage.
 When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability
 modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to
 the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for dam
age and whether to add any modifiers.
 If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than
 onetarget at the same time, roll the damage once for all
 of them. For example, When a wizard casts fireball or a
 cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once
 for all creatures caught in the blast.
 Critical Hits
 When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice
 for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the
 attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then
 add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play,
 you can roll all the damage dice at once.
 For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,
 roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add
 your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other
 damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack fea
152
ture, you roll those dice twice as well.
 Describing the Effects of Damage
 Damage Types
 Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful ef
fects deal different types of damage. Damage types have
 no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage
 resistance, rely on the types.
 The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM
 assign a damage type to a new effect.
 Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath
 and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding
 deal acid damage.
 Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling,
 constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
 Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s
 spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal
 cold damage.
 Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells con
jure flames to deal fire damage.
 Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a
 damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are
 spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.
 Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s
 breath deal lightning damage.
 Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead
 and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even
 the soul.
 Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including
 spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.
 Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green
 dragon’s breath deal poison damage.
 Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s
 psionic blast deal psychic damage.
 Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame
 strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh
 like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
 Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal
 slashing damage.
 Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the ef
fect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.
 Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
 Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or
 unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
 If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage
 type, damageofthattypeishalvedagainstit. Ifacreature
 or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage
 of that type is doubled against it.
 Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all
 other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has
 resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack
 that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also
 within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The
 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the
 creature takes 10 damage.
 Multipleinstancesofresistanceorvulnerabilitythataf
fect the same damage type count as only one instance.
 For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage
 as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the dam
age of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the
 creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
 Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways.
 When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit
 point maximum, youtypically show no signs of injury. When
 youdropbelowhalfyourhitpointmaximum,youshowsigns
 of wear, suchascutsandbruises. Anattackthatreducesyou
 to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury
 or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.
 Healing
 Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even
 death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can re
store a creature’s hit points (as explained in chapter 8),
 and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a
 potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.
 Whenacreaturereceiveshealingofanykind,hitpoints
 regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s
 hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit
 points regained in excess of this number are lost. For
 example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing.
 If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
 maximumof20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the
 druid, not 8.
 A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until
 magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.
 Dropping to 0 Hit Points
 When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or
 fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
 Instant Death
 Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage re
duces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining,
 you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your
 hit point maximum.
 For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points
 currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from
 an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage
 remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit
 point maximum, the cleric dies.
 Falling Unconscious
 If damage reduces you to 0hit points and fails to kill you,
 youfall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconscious
ness ends if you regain any hit points.
 Death Saving Throws
 Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must
 makeaspecial saving throw, called a death saving throw,
 to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang
 onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to
 any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided
 only by spells and features that improve your chances of
 succeeding on a saving throw.
 Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Oth
erwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by it
self. On your third success, you become stable (see be
low). On your third failure, you die. The successes and
 failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both
 until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is
 reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become
 stable.
 153
Rolling 1 or20. Whenyoumakeadeathsavingthrow
 and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you
 roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
 Damageat0HitPoints. Ifyoutakeanydamagewhile
 you have0hitpoints, you sufferadeathsavingthrowfail
ure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two
 failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your
 hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
 Stabilizing a Creature
 The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to
 heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least
 be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving
 throw.
 You can use your action to administer first aid to an
 unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which
 requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
 A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws,
 even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain uncon
scious. The creature stops being stable, and must start
 makingdeathsavingthrowsagain,ifittakesanydamage.
 Astablecreaturethatisn’t healed regains1hitpointafter
 1d4 hours.
 Monsters and Death
 MostDMshaveamonsterdietheinstantitdropsto0hit
 points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make
 death saving throws. Mighty villains and special non
player characters are commonexceptions; the DMmight
 have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as
 player characters.
 Knocking a Creature Out
 Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe,
 rather thandealakillingblow. Whenanattackerreduces
 acreatureto0hitpointswithameleeattack,theattacker
 can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this
 choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
 unconscious and is stable.
 Temporary Hit Points
 Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit
 points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual
 hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit
 points that protect you from injury.
 Whenyouhave temporary hit points and take damage
 the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover
 damagecarriesovertoyournormalhitpoints. Forexam
ple, if you have5temporaryhitpointsandtake7damage,
 you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 dam
age.
 Because temporary hit points are separate from your
 actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maxi
mum. Acharactercan, therefore, be at full hit points and
 receive temporary hit points.
 Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they
 can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points
 and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep
 the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example,
 if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you
 already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
 If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points
 doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.
 Theycanstill absorbdamagedirectedatyouwhileyou’re
 in that state, but only true healing can save you.
 Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points
 has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you fin
ish a long rest.
 MountedCombat
 A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard
 casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soar
ing through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of
 speed and mobility that a mount can provide.
 A willing creature that is at least one size larger than
 you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a
 mount, using the following rules.
 Mounting and Dismounting
 Once during your move, you can mount a creature that
 is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an
 amount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex
ample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of
 movement to mountahorse. Therefore, you can’t mount
 it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your
 speed is 0.
 If an effect moves your mount against its will while
 you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity sav
ing throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space
 within5feetofit. Ifyou’reknockedpronewhilemounted,
 you must make the same saving throw.
 If your mountis knockedprone, youcanuseyourreac
tion to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Other
wise, youaredismountedandfallproneinaspacewithin
 5 feet it.
 Controlling a Mount
 While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can
 either control the mount or allow it to act independently.
 Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
 You can control a mount only if it has been trained to
 accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and sim
ilar creatures are assumed to have such training. The
 initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours
 when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has
 only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
 A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn
 that you mount it.
 Anindependentmountretainsitsplaceintheinitiative
 order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions
 the mountcantake, andit movesandactsasitwishes. It
 mightfleefromcombat,rushtoattackanddevourabadly
 injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.
 In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity
 attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or
 the mount.
 Underwater Combat
 When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their under
sea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or
 f
 ind themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must
 f
 ight in a challenging environment. Underwater the fol
lowing rules apply.
 Whenmakingameleeweaponattack,acreaturethat
 doesn’thaveaswimmingspeed(eithernaturalorgranted
 154
by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the
 weaponis adagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
 A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a tar
get beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a
 target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvan
tage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon
 that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or
 dart).
 Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water
 have resistance to fire damage.

Chapter 10: Spellcasting
 M
 agic permeates the worlds of D&D and
 most often appears in the form of a spell.
 This chapter provides the rules for casting
 spells. Different character classes have dis
tinctive waysoflearningandpreparingtheir
 spells, and monsters use spells in unique
 ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules
 here.
 WhatIs aSpell?
 A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of
 the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a
 specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a charac
ter carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic
 suffusingtheworld,pinstheminplaceinaparticularpat
tern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then re
leases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases,
 all in the span of seconds.
 Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective
 wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or re
moveconditions(see appendixA),drainlife energy away,
 and restore life to the dead.
 Uncountedthousandsofspells have been created over
 the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them
 are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crum
bling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in
 the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be rein
vented by a character who has amassed enough power
 and wisdom to do so.
 Spell Level
 Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a
 general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly
 (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the
 earth-shakingwishat9th. Cantrips—simplebutpowerful
 spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level
 0. Thehigher aspell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster
 must be to use that spell.
 Spell level and character level don’t correspond di
rectly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level,
 not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
 KnownandPrepared Spells
 Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have
 the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the
 spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, includ
ing bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they
 know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is
 true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters,
 suchasclerics andwizards, undergoaprocessofprepar
ing spells. This process varies for different classes, as
 detailed in their descriptions.
 Casting in Armor
 Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required
 for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you
 are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted
 and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
 In every case, the number of spells a caster can have
 f
 ixedinmindatanygiventimedependsonthecharacter’s
 level.
 Spell Slots
 Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or pre
pares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells
 before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and
 channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physi
cally and mentallytaxing, andhigher-level spells are even
 more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (ex
cept that of the warlock) includes a table showing how
 many spell slots of each spell level a character can use
 at each character level. For example, the 3rd-leve1 wiz
ardUmarahasfour1st-leve1spellslotsandtwo2nd-level
 slots.
 When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a
 slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot
 with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of
 a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell
 of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size,
 but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when
 Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends
 one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.
 Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots
 (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
 Some characters and monsters have special abilities
 that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For
 example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Ele
ments, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invoca
tions, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast
 spells in such a way.
 Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
 When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a
 higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher
 level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic
 missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic mis
sile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the
 slot it is put into.
 Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds,
 have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level,
 as detailed in a spell’s description.
 Cantrips
 A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without us
ing a spell slot and without being prepared in advance.
 Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind
 and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce
 the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.
 Rituals
 Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can
 be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the
 spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell
 takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
 It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the rit
ual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.
 Tocast aspell as aritual, a spellcaster must have a fea
ture that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the
 157
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must
 also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells
 known,unlessthecharacter’s ritual feature specifies oth
erwise, as the wizard’s does.
 Casting a Spell
 When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules
 are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the
 spell’s effects.
 Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a
 block of information, including the spell’s name, level,
 school of magic, casting time, range, components, and
 duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s
 effect.
 Casting Time
 Most spells require a single action to cast, but some
 spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more
 time to cast.
 Bonus Action
 A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You
 must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
 provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action
 this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same
 turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.
 Reactions
 Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take
 a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in re
sponse to someevent. If a spell can be cast as a reaction,
 the spell description tells you exactly whenyoucandoso.
 Longer Casting Times
 Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require
 more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you
 cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single ac
tion or reaction, you must spend your action each turn
 casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentra
tion while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your
 concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t ex
pendaspellslot. Ifyouwanttotrycastingthespellagain,
 you must start over.
 Range
 Thetarget of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For
 a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a
 spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where
 the ball of fire erupts.
 Mostspellshaverangesexpressedinfeet. Somespells
 can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.
 Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you.
 These spells have a range of self.
 Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate
 from you also have a range of self, indicating that the ori
gin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of
 Effect” later in the this chapter).
 Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its
 range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
 Components
 A spell’s components are the physical requirements you
 must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description in
dicates whetherit requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or ma
terial (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more
 of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.
 Verbal (V)
 Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The
 words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power;
 rather, the particular combination of sounds, with spe
cific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in
 motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area
 of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t
 cast a spell with a verbal component.
 Somatic (S)
 Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticula
tion or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a
 somatic component, the caster must have free use of at
 least one hand to perform these gestures.
 Material (M)
 Castingsomespellsrequiresparticularobjects, specified
 in parentheses in the component entry. A character can
 use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found
 in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a
 spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a char
acter musthavethatspecificcomponentbeforeheorshe
 can cast the spell.
 If a spell states that amaterialcomponentisconsumed
 by the spell, the caster must provide this component for
 each casting of the spell.
 Aspellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s
 material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—

 somatic components.
 Duration
 A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists.
 A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,
 or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last
 until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
 Instantaneous
 Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,
 creates, oraltersacreatureoranobjectinawaythatcan’t
 be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.
 Concentration
 Somespells require you to maintain concentration in or
der to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration,
 such a spell ends.
 If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that
 fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies
 howlongyoucanconcentrate on it. You can end concen
tration at any time (no action required).
 Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t
 interfere with concentration. The following factors can
 break concentration:
 • Casting another spell that requires concentration.
 You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another
 spell that requires concentration. You can’t concen
trate on two spells at once.
 • Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while
 you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
 158
Targets
 Constitution saving throw to maintain your concen
tration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you
 take, whichever number is higher. If you take dam
age from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a
 dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for
 each source of damage.
 • Beingincapacitatedorkilled. Youloseconcentration
 on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
 The DM might also decide that certain environmen
tal phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while
 you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on
 a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concen
tration on a spell.
 The Schools of Magic
 Academiesofmagicgroupspellsintoeightcategoriescalled
 schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these
 categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in
 essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous
 study or is bestowed by a deity.
 The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
 rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
 Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some
 of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
 negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish crea
tures to other planes of existence.
 Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects
 and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
 summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas
 others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
 conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
 Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form
 of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the loca
tions of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions
 of distant people or places.
 Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influenc
ing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make en
emies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a
 course of action, or even control another creature like a pup
pet.
 Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a
 desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Oth
ers channel positive energy to heal wounds.
 Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others.
 They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss
 things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remem
ber things that never happened. Someillusionscreatephan
tomimagesthatanycreaturecansee,butthemostinsidious
 illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
 Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and
 death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,
 drain the life energy from another creature, create the un
dead, or even bring the dead back to life.
 Creating the undead through the use of necromancy
 spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil
 casters use such spells frequently.
 Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature,
 object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a
 harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an
 object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a crea
ture’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.
 A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets
 to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description
 tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or
 a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
 Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might
 not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like
 crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect,
 suchasanattempttoreadacreature’sthoughts, typically
 goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
 AClear Path totheTarget
 To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so
 it can’t be behind total cover.
 If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t
 see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you
 and that point, the point of origin comes into being on
 the near side of that obstruction.
 Targeting Yourself
 If a spell targets acreatureofyourchoice, youcanchoose
 yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifi
cally a creature other than you. If you are in the area of
 effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
 Areas of Effect
 Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an
 area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
 A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which
 typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,
 cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point
 of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts.
 The rules for each shape specify how you position its
 point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
 space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a
 creature or an object.
 Aspell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point
 of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the
 point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
 location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of
 these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total
 cover, as explained in chapter 9.
 Cone
 A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point
 of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length
 is equal to that points distance from the point of origin.
 Acone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
 A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s
 area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
 Cube
 You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere
 on aface of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed
 as the length of each side.
 A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s
 area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
 Cylinder
 A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a
 particular radius, as given in the spell description. The
 circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the
 spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight
 159
lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the cir
cle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect
 then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a
 distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
 Acylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s
 area of effect.
 Line
 A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path
 up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
 Aline’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of
 effect, unless you decide otherwise.
 Sphere
 You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere ex
tends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is ex
pressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.
 A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s
 area of effect.
 Saving Throws
 Manyspellsspecifythatatargetcanmakeasavingthrow
 to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell speci
f
 ies the ability that the target uses for the save and what
 happens on a success or failure.
 The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your
 spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus +
 any special modifiers.
 Attack Rolls
 Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to
 determine whether the spell effect hits the intended tar
get. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your
 spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.
 Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged at
tacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a
 ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile
 creature that can seeyouandthatisn’tincapacitated (see
 chapter 9).
 Combining Magical Effects
 Theeffectsofdifferentspellsaddtogetherwhilethedura
tions of thosespellsoverlap. Theeffectsofthesamespell
 cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead,
 the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from
 those castings applies while their durations overlap. Or
 the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally
 potent and their durations overlap.
 For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same tar
get, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he
 or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.
 The Weave of Magic
 The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
 All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential
 energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living crea
ture, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of
 creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeat
ing every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of
 energy throughout the multiverse.
 Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they
 makeuseofafabricofmagic,akindofinterfacebetweenthe
 will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcast
ers of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize
 its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied
 ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name,
 without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inacces
sible; the most powerful archmage can’t light a candle with
 magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But sur
rounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to
 blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye,
 or even reverse death itself.
 All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
 of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards,
 warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane
 magic. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or
 intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks
 directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired ef
fect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
 magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers
 are called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the
 Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces
 of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.
 Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the
 Weaveintertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.
 When characters use divination spells such as detect magic
 or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel
 magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field re
arrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than
 through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where
 the Weaveisdamagedortorn, magicworksinunpredictable
 ways—or not at all.

 his chapter describes the most common
 spells in the worlds of Dungeons & Drag
ons. The chapter begins with the spell lists
 of the spellcasting classes, where a spell’s
 school of magic is noted in parentheses after
 the spell’s name, and the nameisfollowedby
 an asterisk if the spell has the ritual tag. The remainder

 red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak
 a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast
 165
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
 location, coveringabout50milesper24hoursforaflying

 Whenthe messenger arrives, it delivers your message
 to the creature that you described, replicating the sound

ber of willing creatures that you can see within range.
 You transform each target into the form of a Large or
 smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On
 subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform
 affected creatures into new forms.
 The transformation lasts for the duration for each tar
get, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You
 can choose a different form for each target. A target’s
 game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the cho
sen beast, though the target retains its alignment and In
telligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target as
sumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts
 to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points
 it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of
 dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over
 to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
 reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t
 knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the ac
tions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it
 can’t speak or cast spells.
 The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
 can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its
 equipment.
 Animate Dead
 3rd-level necromancy
 Casting Time: 1 minute
 Range: 10 feet
 Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh,
 and a pinch of bone dust)
 Duration: Instantaneous
 This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of
 bonesoracorpseofaMediumorSmallhumanoidwithin
 range. Yourspellimbuesthetargetwithafoulmimicryof
 life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes
 a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a
 corpse (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).
 On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to
 mentally commandanycreatureyoumadewiththisspell
 if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control mul
tiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at
 the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
 You decide what action the creature will take and where
 it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a gen
eral command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
 corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
 defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an
 order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is
 complete.
 The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after
 which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To
 maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours,
 you must cast this spell on the creature again before the
 current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell re
asserts your control over up to four creatures you have
 animated with this spell, rather than animating a new
 one.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
 spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
 control over two additional undead creatures for each
 slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come
 from a different corpse or pile of bones.
 Animate Objects
 5th-level transmutation
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 120 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to
 ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being
 worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects,
 Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count
 as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than
 Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature un
der your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0
 hit points.
 As a bonus action, you can mentally command any
 creature you madewiththis spell if the creature is within
 500feet of you(if you control multiple creatures, you can
 command any or all of them at the same time, issuing
 the samecommandtoeachone). Youdecidewhataction
 the creature will take and where it will move during its
 next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as
 to guard aparticular chamber or corridor. If you issue no
 commands, the creature only defends itself against hos
tile creatures. Once given an order, the creature contin
ues to follow it until its task is complete.
 An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points,
 attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
 Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom
 are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the
 object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for loco
motion, it instead has a flying speed 0f 30 feet and can
 hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a
 larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed
 is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind
 beyond that distance. When the animated object drops
 to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and
 any remaining damage carries over to its original object
 form.
 166
If you command an object to attack, it can make a sin
gle melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It
 makes aslamattack with an attack bonus and bludgeon
ing damage determined by its size. The DM might rule
 that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage
 based on its form.
 At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
 slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional
 objects for each slot level above 5th.

 Antilife Shell
 5th-level abjuration
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Self (10-foot radius)
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
 Ashimmeringbarrierextendsoutfromyouina10-foot
 radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you
 and hedging out creatures other than undead and con
structs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
 Thebarrierpreventsanaffectedcreaturefrompassing
 or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells
 or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through
 the barrier.
 If you move so that an affected creature is forced to
 pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
 Antimagic Field
 8th-level abjuration
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
 Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron
 f
 ilings)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
 A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic sur
rounds you. This area is divorced from the magical en
ergy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere,
 spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and
 evenmagicitemsbecomemundane. Untilthespellends,
 the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
 Spells and other magical effects, except those created
 by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
 and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a sup
pressedspellisconsumed. Whileaneffectissuppressed,
 it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
 counts against its duration.
 Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
 such as magic missile and charm person, that target a
 creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that
 target.
 Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical
 effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the
 sphereoverlapsanareaofmagic,thepartoftheareathat
 is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the
 f
 lamescreated byawalloffirearesuppressedwithin the
 sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large
 enough.
 Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
 creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
 the creature or object is in it.
 Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic
 items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a
 +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical
 longsword.
 A magic weapon’s properties and powers are sup
pressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
 wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon
 or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
 (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
 spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
 item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
 Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to
 workinthesphere, whetherthesphereisthedestination
 or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal
 to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well
 as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that
 created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes While
 in the sphere.
 Creatures and Objects. A creature or object sum
monedorcreatedbymagictemporarilywinksoutofexis
tence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears
 once the space the creature occupied is no longer within
 the sphere.
 Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dis
pel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
 spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t
 nullify each other.
 Antipathy/Sympathy
 8th-level enchantment
 Casting Time: 1 hour
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in
 vinegar for the antipathy effect or adropofhoneyfor
 the sympathy effect)
 Duration: 10 days
 This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
 You target something within range, either a Huge or
 smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger
 than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
 creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
 invest thetargetwithanaurathateitherattractsorrepels
 the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipa
thy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
 Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
 kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
 area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see
 the target or comes within 60feet of it, the creature must
 succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become fright
ened. The creature remains frightened while it can see
 the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by
 the target, the creature must use its movement to move
 to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target.
 If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target
 167
and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but
 the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight
 of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
 Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
 creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
 while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
 creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,
 the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
 use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area
 or move within reach of the target. When the creature
 has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the tar
get. If the target damagesorotherwiseharmsanaffected
 creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom sav
ing throw to end the effect, as described below.
 EndingtheEffect. Ifanaffectedcreatureendsitsturn
 while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the
 creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a success
ful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target
 andrecognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as
 magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is
 allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours
 while the spell persists.
 Acreature that successfully saves against this effect is
 immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be af
fected again.
 Arcane Eye
 4th-level divination
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
 You create an invisible, magical eye within range that
 hovers in the air for the duration.
 You mentally receive visual information from the eye,
 which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.
 The eye can look in every direction.
 As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
 any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you
 the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of ex
istence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but
 the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch
 in diameter.
 Arcane Gate
 6th-level conjuration
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 500 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 You create linked teleportation portals that remain
 open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground
 that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one
 point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet
 in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
 open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
 and the casting is lost.
 The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled
 with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpen
dicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible
 only from one side (your choice), which is the side that
 functions as a portal.
 Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
 the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other;
 passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no
 effect. Themistthatfillseachportalisopaqueandblocks
 visionthroughit. Onyourturn,youcanrotatetheringsas
 a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different
 direction.
 Arcane Lock
 2nd-level abjuration
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Touch
 Components: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp,
 which the spell consumes)
 Duration: Until dispelled
 You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other

 Duration: Special
 You and up to eight willing creatures within range
 project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell
 fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that
 plane). The material body you leave behind is uncon
scious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t
 need food or air and doesn’t age.
 Your astral body resembles your mortal forminalmost
 every way, replicating your game statistics and posses
sions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery
 cordthatextendsfrombetweenyourshoulderbladesand
 trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This
 cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the
 tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the
 cord is cut—something that can happen only when an ef
fect specifically states that it does—your soul and body
 are separated, killing you instantly.
 Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
 Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
 other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
 plane you wereonwhencastingthisspell, your body and
 possessions are transported along the silver cord, allow
ing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
 Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage

 Thespell ends for you and your companions whenyou
 use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the af
fected creature returns to its physical body, and it awak

 The spell might also end early for you or one of
 your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
 against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
 creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form
 drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
 the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
 the creature’s astral form backtoits body, endingitsstate
 of suspended animation.

 For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain
 creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on
 eachturnuntilthespellends, youcanfocusyourmindon
 any onecreature that youcanseewithin30feetofyou. If
 the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower
 or doesn’t speakanylanguage, thecreatureisunaffected.
 You initially learn the surface thoughts of the
 creature—what is most on its mind in that moment.
 As an action, you can either shift your attention to
 another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper
 into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the
 target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you
 gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
 and something that looms large in its mind (such as
 something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
 the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you
 are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your
 attentio to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can
 use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
 contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the
 spell ends.
 Questions verbally directed at the target creature nat
urally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is
 particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
 You can also use this spell to detect the presence of
 thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell
 or as your action during the duration, you can search for
 thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate
 barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
 than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t
 detect a creature with anIntelligence of 3 orlowerorone
 that doesn’t speak any language.
 Onceyoudetect the presence of a creature in this way,
 you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as
 described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still
 be within range.

 weapons, andother belongings on your person—look dif
ferent until the spell ends or until you use your action to
 dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can
 appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your
 body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same
 basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the
 illusion is up to you.
 The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
 physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to
 add ahattoyouroutfit, objects pass through the hat, and
 anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel
 your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thin
ner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out
 to touch youwouldbumpintoyouwhileitwasseemingly

 with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of
 existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue com
mandstothecreaturewhileyouareconscious(noaction
 required), which it does its best to obey. You canspecify a
 simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that
 creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the
 creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further
 direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the
 best of its ability.
 You can use your action to take total and precise con
trol of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the
 creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t
 doanything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time
 youcanalsocausethecreaturetouseareaction, butthis
 requires you to use your own reaction as well.
 Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
 Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving
 throw succeeds, the spell ends.

 created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to
 cast this spell can’t extinguish the light.

 rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manu
factured structures, equipment, and creatures within the

 The tactile characteristics of the terrain are un
changed, so creatures entering the area are likely to see
 through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by

tempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your

 it and enters the container you used for the spell’s mate
rial component. While your soul inhabits the container,
 you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the
 containers space. You can’t move or use reactions. The
 only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100
 feet out of the container, either returning to your living

 humanoids body.
 You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100
 feet of youthatyoucansee(creatureswardedbyaprotec

wise, you die.
 If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your

 appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create suffi
cient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough
 to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell
 that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
 As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can
 use your action to cause the image to move to any other
 spot within range. As the image changes location, you
 can alter its appearance so that its movements appear
 natural for the image. For example, if you create an im
age of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so
 that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause
 the illusion to make different sounds at different times,
 even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
 Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
 illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
 that uses its action to examine the image can determine
 that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (In
vestigation) check against your spell save DC. If a crea
ture discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can
 see throughtheimage, anditsothersensoryqualities be

 be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
 action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab it
self, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
 other obviously harmful act automatically negates the ef
fect of the spell.
 Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
 failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
 to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
 can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested ac
tivity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
 when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
 You can also specify conditions that will trigger a spe
cial activity during the duration. For example, you might
 suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to
 the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met be
fore the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed.
 If you or any of your companions damage a creature
 affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

 muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger

 Casting Time: 10 minutes
 Range: Sight
 Components: V, S
 Duration: 10 days
 You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look,
 sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of ter
rain. Theterrain’s general shape remains the same, how
ever. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a
 swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impass
able terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy
 meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn
 gully like a wide and smooth road.
 Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures,
 or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t
 disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
 The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfac
tory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult
 terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement
 through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such
 as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area
 disappears immediately.
 Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion
 to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of
 the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the
 illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically inter
act with the illusion.

 permanently eliminate all memory of theevent, allow the
 target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting
 detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or
 create a memory of some other event.
 You must speak to the target to describe how its mem
ories are affected, and it must be able to understand
 your language for the modified memories to take root.

 the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t al
tered. Otherwise, the modified memorie take hold when
 the spell ends.
 A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a
 creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts
 the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.
 Anillogical modifiedmemory,suchasimplantingamem
ory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in
 acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM

where in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and
 other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke

 and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to com
plete.
 At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrat

 Duration: Instantaneous
 A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your finger

plodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within
 the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
 failed save, a creature takes 10d6colddamage. Onasuc
cessful save, it takes half as much damage.
 If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
 principally water (not including water-based creatures),
 it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area

 that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are
 trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action
 to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to

 the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a
 sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At

 Phantasmal Force
 2nd-level illusion
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a
 creature that you can see within range. The target must
 212
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you
 createaphantasmalobject,creature,orothervisiblephe
nomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot
 cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the du
ration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
 Thephantasmincludessound,temperature, andother
 stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
 Thetarget can use its action to examine the phantasm
 with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
 spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes
 that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
 While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats
 the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes
 any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phan
tasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a
 phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps
 onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still be
lieves that the bridge exists and comes up with some
 other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped,
 or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
 An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s
 reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A
 phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the
 target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a
 pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on
 your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to
 the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet
 of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a crea
ture or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as
 by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type
 appropriate to the illusion.
 Phantasmal Killer
 4th-level illusion
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 120 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see
 within range and create an illusory manifestation of its
 deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target

 target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of
 each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target
 must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10
 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
 spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by
 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
 Phantom Steed
 3rd-level illusion (ritual)
 Casting Time: 1 minute
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: 1 hour
 A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the
 ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within
 range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is
 equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equip
ment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it
 is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.
 For theduration, you or acreature youchoosecanride
 the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding
 horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10
 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the
 spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1
 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action
 to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
 Planar Ally
 6th-level conjuration
 Casting Time: 10 minutes
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Instantaneous
 You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The be
ing must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon
 prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity
 sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid
 you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space
 within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you
 can speak that name when you cast this spell to request
 that creature, though you might get a different creature
 anyway (DM’s choice).
 Whenthe creature appears, it is under no compulsion
 to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature
 to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t
 obliged to do so. The requested task could range from
 simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle)
 to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our
 foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communi
cate with the creature to bargain for its services.
 Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might
 require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an
 allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacri
f
 ice oragift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange
 their service for a quest undertaken by you.
 Asaruleofthumb,ataskthatcanbemeasuredinmin
utes requires a paymentworth100gpperminute. Atask
 measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a
 task measuredindays(upto10days)requires10,000gp
 per day. TheDMcanadjustthesepaymentsbasedonthe
 circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task
 is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might
 be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically
 require only half the suggestedpayment, whileespecially
 dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures
 rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
 After the creature completes the task, or when the
 agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature re
turns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if ap
propriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to
 agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature
 immediately returns to its home plane.
 A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a
 member of it, receiving a full share of experience points
 awarded.

Casting Time: 1 hour
 Range: 60 feet

 which the spell consumes)
 Duration: 24 hours
 With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an el
emental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature
 must be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
 (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the cen
ter of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped
 while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the cast
ing, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On
 a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If
 the creature was summoned or created by another spell,
 that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of
 this spell.
 A bound creature must follow your instructions to the
 best of its ability. You might command the creature to ac
company you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to
 deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your
 instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives
 to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the
 creature carries out your instructions completely before
 the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you
 are on the sameplane of existence. If you are on a differ
ent plane of existence, it returns to the place where you
 bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
 spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10
 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot,
 to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day
 with a 9th-level spell slot.

 you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example,
 you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of
 Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire,
 at the DM’s discretion.
 Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a tele
portation circle on another plane of existence, this spell
 can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is
 too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they
 appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the cir

 make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The
 spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with
 0 hit points.
 The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the
 target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can
 be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less
 than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a
 challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including
 mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the
 chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
 The target assumes the hit points of its new form.
 When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns
 to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.
 214
If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any ex
cess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as
 the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal
 form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
 Thecreature is limited in the actions it can perform by
 the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells,
 or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
 The target’s gear melds into the new form. The crea
ture can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from
 any of its equipment.

pied by acreature, the spell fails, and your action and the
 spell slot are wasted.
 The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet
 and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and crea
tures youdesignateatthetimeyoucastthespellcanpass
 through and remain near the wall without harm. If an
other creature that can see the wall moves to within 20
 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must suc
ceed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded
 for 1 minute.
 The wall consists of seven layers, each with a differen
 color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass
 through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through
 all the walls layers. As it passes or reaches through each
 layer, the creature must makeaDexteritysavingthrowor
 be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.
 The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in
 order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer.
 Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration
 of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it.
 1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a
 failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks
 can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed
 by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. 2. Orange. The
 creature takes 10d6 acid damage on afailed save, or half
 as muchdamageonasuccessful one. While this layer is
 in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the
 wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. 3. Yel
low. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a
 failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force
 damage to it. 4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison
 damageonafailedsave,orhalfasmuchdamageonasuc
cessful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or
 greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, de
stroys this layer. 5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold
 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
 successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at
 least 25 fire damage to it. 6. Indigo. On a failed save,
 the creature is restrained. It must then make a Consti
tution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
 successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails
 its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is
 subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and
 failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both
 until the creaturecollects three ofakind. Whilethislayer
 is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. Thelayer
 is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a
 similar spell of equal or higher level. 7. Violet. On a
 failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make
 a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A
 successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save,
 the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s
 choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature
 that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished
 home, while other creatures are usually cast into the As
tral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dis
pel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level
 that can end spells and magical effects.

 Programmed Illusion
 6th-level illusion
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 120 feet
 Components: V,S,M(abitoffleeceandjadedustworth
 at least 25 gp)
 Duration: Until dispelled
 You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some
 other visible phenomenon within range that activates
 when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imper
ceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot
 cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the il
lusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted
 performance can last up to 5 minutes.
 When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion
 springs into existence and performs in the manner you
 described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it dis
appears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this
 time, the illusion can be activated again.

Range: Touch
 The triggering condition can be as general or as de

 example, you could create an illusion of yourself to ap
pear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped
 door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a
 creature says the correct word or phrase.
 Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
 illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
 that uses its action to examine the image can determine
 that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves
tigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
 discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
 through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hol
low to the creature.

 iron, which the spell consumes)
 Duration: Concentration up to 10 minutes
 Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is
 protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations,
 celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
 The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of
 those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the
 target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or
 possessed by them. If the target is already charmed,
 frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target
 has advantage on any new saving throw against the rele

ture’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body,
 the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
 This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures non
magical diseases that affected the creature at the time it
 died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical dis
eases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first re
movedpriortocastingthespell, theytakeeffectwhenthe
 creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead
 creature to life.
 This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t re
store missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body

parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for
 instance—the spell automatically fails.

 the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

 5th-level transmutation
 Casting Time: 1 hour
 Range: Touch
 Components: V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at
 least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 Duration: Instantaneous
 You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead hu
manoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no
 longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for
 it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the tar
get’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails. The
 magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit,
 which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The
 DMrolls a d100 and consults the following table to de
termine what form the creature takes when restored to
 life, or the DM chooses a form.

 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Touch
 Components: V, S

 they afflict the target on its return to life.
 This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any
 missing body parts.
 Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
 takes a-4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
 ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest

 saving throws.

terity saving throwtograbontoafixedobjectitcanreach,
 thus avoiding the fall.
 If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered

 Casting Time: 10 minutes
 Range: Self
 Components: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp,
 such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled
 with holy water)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 You can see and hear a particular creature you choose
 that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target
 must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified
 by how well you know the target and the sort of physical
 connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re cast
ing this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it
 wants to be observed.
 On asuccessful save, the target isn’t affected, and you
 can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

 Searing Smite
 1st-level evocation
 Casting Time: 1 bonus action
 Range: Self
 Components: V
 Duration: Concentration. up to 1 minute
 The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon
 attack during the spell’s duration, your weapon flares
 with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra
 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to
 ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the
 spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving
 throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a

 if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target
 being submerged in water). the spell ends.

 spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage
 dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level

 See Invisibility
 2nd-level divination
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Self
 Components: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprin
kling of powdered silver)
 Duration: 1 hour
 For the duration, you see invisible creatures and ob
jects as if they were visible, and you can see into the
 Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear
 ghostly and translucent.
 Seeming
 5th-level illusion
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: 8 hours
 This spell allows you to change the appearance of any
 number of creatures that you can see within range. You
 give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance.
 220
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
 and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
 The spell disguises physical appearance as well as
 clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make
 each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear
 thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body
 type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic
 arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illu
sion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless
 you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
 The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
 physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
 to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through
 the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or
 would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this
 spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of some
one who reaches out to touch you would bump into you
 while it was seemingly still in midair.
 A creature can use its action to inspect a target and
 make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
 spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the
 target is disguised.
 Sending
 3rd-level evocation
 Casting Time: 1 action

 hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the
 sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like man
ner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intel
ligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of
 your message.
 You can send the message across any distance and
 even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on
 a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance
 that the message doesn’t arrive.

 emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least

 By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object
 can be hidden away, safe from detection for the dura
tion. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it be
comes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells
 or perceived through scrying sensors created by divina
tion spells.
 If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of sus
pended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it
 doesn’t grow older.
 You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The
 condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur
 or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples in
clude “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awak

 statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus

 When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
 number of hit points you had before you transformed. If
 you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any ex
cess damage carries over to your normal form. As long
 as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form
 to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
 You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
 race, or other source and can use them, provided that
 your newformisphysicallycapableofdoingso. Youcan’t

 unless your new form also has that sense. You can only

 When you transform, you choose whether your equip

pear natural for the image. For example, if you create an

 the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit
 point maximum and is formed without any equipment.
 Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the crea
ture it duplicates, except that it is a construct.
 The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you
 designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and
 acting in accordancewithyourwishesandactingonyour
 turn in combat. Thesimulacrumlackstheabilitytolearn

 Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent
 teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
 “Associated object” means that you possess an object
 taken from the desired destination within the last six
 months, suchasabookfromaWizard’slibrary, bedlinen
 from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s se
cret tomb.
 “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often,
 a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can
 see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is some
place you have seen more than once but with which you
 aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have
 seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place
 whoselocation andappearanceyouknowthroughsome
one else’s description, perhaps from a map.
 “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Per
haps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead
 viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a
 familiar location that no longer exists.
 On Target. You and your group (or the target object)
 appear where you want to.
 Off Target. You and your group (or the target object)
 appear a random distance away from the destination in
 a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10
 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For ex
ample, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target,
 and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be
 offtarget by15percent, or18miles. TheDMdetermines
 the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and des
ignating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on
 around the points of the compass. If you were teleport
ing to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea,
 you could be in trouble.
 Similar Area. You and your group (or the target ob
ject) wind up in a different area that’s visually or themat
ically similar to the target area. If you are heading for
 your homelaboratory, for example, you might wind up in
 another Wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply
 shop that has many of the same tools and implements
 as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest
 similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you
 could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
 Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
 difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target
 object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on
 the table to seewhereyouwindup(multiplemishapscan
 occur, dealing damage each time).
 Teleportation Circle
 5th-level conjuration
 Casting Time: 1 minute
 Range: 10 feet
 Components: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with
 precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell con
sumes)
 Duration: 1 round
 As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter cir
cle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your lo
cation to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice
 whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same
 plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens
 withinthecircleyoudrewandremainsopenuntiltheend
 of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal in
stantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or
 in thenearestunoccupiedspaceifthatspaceisoccupied.
 Many major temples, guilds, and other important
 places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed
 somewhere within their confines. Each such circle in
cludes auniquesigil sequence—astringofmagicalrunes
 arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the
 ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for
 two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by
 the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during
 your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence
 to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
 You can create a permanent teleportation circle by
 casting this spell in the same location every day for one
 year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you
 cast the spell in this way.

 Duration: 1 hour
 This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
 3feetindiameterand1inchthick,thatfloats3feetabove
 the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that
 you can see within range. The disk remains for the du
ration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
 is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
 falls to the ground.
 The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
 it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
 follows you so that it remains within 20feet of you. It can
 move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes
 and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10
 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across
 a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was
 created at the bottom.
 If you movemorethan100feetfromthedisk(typically
 because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you),
 the spell ends.

tion. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
 appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
 (your choice which side). Nothing can physically pass

 The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus
 breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot sec
tion, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10
foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves

 Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other
 panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot
 panels that are only 3 inches thick.
 If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it ap

 choice). If a creature wouldbesurroundedonallsidesby
 the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that crea

 can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is
 no longer enclosed by the wall.
 Thewallcanhaveanyshapeyoudesire, thoughitcan’t
 occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall
 doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation.
 It must, however, merge with and besolidly supported by
 existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
 chasm or create a ramp.
 If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you
 must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You
 can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battle
ments, and so on.
 The wall is an object made of stone that can be dam
aged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30
 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit
 points destroys it and might cause connected panels to
 collapse at the DM’s discretion.
 If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its
 whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t
 be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the
 spell ends.

 Weird
 9th-level illusion
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 120 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: Concentration, up to one minute
 Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures,
 you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only
 to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere cen
tered on a point of your choice within range must make
 a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature be
comes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on
 the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst night
mares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the
 frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom
 savingthrowortake4d10psychicdamage. Onasuccess
ful save, the spell ends for that creature.
 Wind Walk
 6th-level transmutation
 Casting Time: 1 minute
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: V, S, M (fire and holy water)
 Duration: 8 hours
 You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within
 rangeassumeagaseousformfortheduration,appearing
 aswispsofcloud. Whileinthiscloudform,acreaturehas
 a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage
 from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature
 can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to
 its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which
 time acreatureis incapacitated and can’t move. Until the
 233
spell ends, acreaturecanreverttocloudform,whichalso
 requires the 1-minute transformation.
 If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the ef
fect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1
 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land
 after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
 Wind Wall
 3rd-level evocation
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 120 feet
 Components: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic
 origin)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point
 you choose within range. You can makethewallupto50
 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape
 the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one
 continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the
 duration.
 When the wall appears, each creature within its area
 must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes
 3d8bludgeoningdamageonafailedsave,orhalfasmuch
 damage on a successful one.
 The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases
 at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects
 can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materi
als brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and
 other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the
 wall are deflectedupwardandautomaticallymiss. (Boul
ders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar pro
jectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t
 pass through it.
 Wish
 9th-level conjuration
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Self
 Components: V
 Duration: Instantaneous
 Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast.
 By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very founda
tions of reality in accord with your desires.
 Thebasicuseofthisspellistoduplicateanyotherspell
 of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any require
ments in that spell. including costly components. The
 spell simply takes effect.
 Alternatively, you can create one of the following ef
fects of your choice:
 • You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that
 isn’t a magic item. Theobjectcanbenomorethan300
 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied
 space you can see on the ground.
 • You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to
 regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them
 described in the greater restoration spell.
 • You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis
tance to a damage type you choose.
 • You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to
 a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For
 instance, youcouldmakeyourselfandallyourcompan
ions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
 • You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of
 any roll madewithin thelast round(including your last
 turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new
 result. For example, a wish spell could undo an oppo
nent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s
 failed save. Youcanforcethererolltobemadewithad
vantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether
 to use the reroll or the original roll.
 You might be able to achieve something beyond the
 scope of the above examples. State your wish to the
 DMasprecisely as possible. The DM has great latitude
 in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater
 the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes
 wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
 might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some
 unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded
 the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
 might propel you forward in time to a period when that
 villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
 the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item
 or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
 of the item’s current owner.
 The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
 other than duplicating another spell weakens you. Af
ter enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell un
til you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage
 per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or
 prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops
 to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each
 of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
 morethanlightactivity, your remaining recovery time de
creases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance
 that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer
 this stress.
 Witch Bolt
 1st-level evocation
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: V, S, M (a twig from a tree that has been
 struck by lightning)
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a
 creature within range, forming a sustained arc of light
ning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell
 attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes
 1d12lightning damage, and oneachofyourturnsfor the
 duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning
 damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you
 use youraction to do anything else. The spell also ends if
 the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total
 cover from you.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
 spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage in
creases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.
 WordofRecall
 6th-level conjuration
 234
Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 5 feet
 Components: V
 Duration: Instantaneous
 You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of
 you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctu
ary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear
 in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you desig
nated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If
 youcast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the
 spell has no effect.
 You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell
 within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or
 strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the
 spell in this mannerinanareathatisn’t dedicated toyour
 deity, the spell has no effect.
 Wrathful Smite
 1st-level evocation
 Casting Time: 1 bonus action
 Range: Self
 Components: V
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
 Thenext time you hit with a melee weapon attack dur
ing this spell’s duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6
 psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature,
 it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
 of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can
 makeaWisdomcheckagainstyourspellsaveDCtosteel
 its resolve and end this spell.
 Zone ofTruth
 2nd-level enchantment
 Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: V, S
 Duration: 10 minutes
 You create a magical zone that guards against decep
tion in a15-foot-radius spherecenteredonapointofyour
 choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that
 enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts
 its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
 failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while
 in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds
 or fails on its saving throw.
 Anaffected creature is aware of the spell and can thus
 avoid answering questions to whichit wouldnormallyre

Appendix A: Conditions
 C
 onditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a
 variety of ways and can arise as a result of a
 spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or
 other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded,
 are impairments, but a few, such as invisible,
 can be advantageous.
 Acondition lasts either until it is countered (the prone
 condition is counteredbystandingup, forexample)orfor
 a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condi
tion.
 If multiple effectsimposethesameconditiononacrea
ture, each instance of the condition has its own duration,
 but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature ei
ther has a condition or doesn’t.
 The following definitions specify what happens to a
 creature while it is subjected to a condition.
 Blinded
 • Ablindedcreaturecan’tseeandautomaticallyfailsany
 ability check that requires sight.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and
 the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
 Charmed
 • Acharmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target
 the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
 • The charmer has advantage on any ability check to in
teract socially with the creature.
 Deafened
 • Adeafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails
 any ability check that requires hearing.
 Frightened
 • A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability
 checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is
 within line of sight.
 • The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source
 of its fear.
 Grappled
 • A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t
 benefit from any bonus to its speed.
 • Theconditionendsifthegrapplerisincapacitated(see
 the condition).
 • The condition also ends if an effect removes the grap
pled creature from the reach of the grappler or grap
pling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by
 the thunderwave spell.
 Incapacitated
 • An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reac
tions.
 Invisible
 • An invisible creature is impossible to see without the
 aid of magic or aspecial sense. For the purpose of hid
ing, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s
 location can be detected by any noise it makes or any
 tracks it leaves.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage,
 and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.
 Exhaustion
 Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as
 starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
 temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaus
tion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give
 a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in
 the effect’s description.
 Level
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 Effect
 Disadvantage on ability checks
 Speed halved
 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
 Hit point maximum halved
 Speed reduced to 0
 Death
 If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
 causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases
 by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
 A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaus
tion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suf
fering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disad
vantage on ability checks.
 An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
 specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion ef
fects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below
 1.
 Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level
 by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food
 and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a crea
ture’s exhaustion level by 1.
 Paralyzed
 • A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condi
tion) and can’t move or speak.
 • The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexter
ity saving throws.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any
 attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the at
tacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
 Petrified
 • Apetrifiedcreatureistransformed,alongwithanynon
magical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid
 inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight in
creases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
 • Thecreature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t
 move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
 • The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexter
ity saving throws.
 • Thecreature has resistance to all damage.

 and ability checks.
 237
Prone
 • A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl,
 unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
 • Thecreature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
 • Anattackroll against the creature has advantage if the
 attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the
 attack roll has disadvantage.
 Restrained
 • A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t
 benefit from any bonus to its speed.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and
 the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
 • The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving
 throws.
 Stunned
 • Astunnedcreatureisincapacitated(seethecondition),
 can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
 • The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexter
ity saving throws.
 • Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

dition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its sur
roundings

Appendix B: Gods of the Multiverse
 R
 eligion is an important part of life in the
 worldsoftheD&Dmultiverse. Whengodswalk
 the world, clerics channel divine power, evil
 cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean
 lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons
 against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent
 about the deities and deny their existence.
 Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different
 gods at different times and circumstances. People in the
 Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for
 luck in love, makeanofferingtoWaukeenbeforeheading
 to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe
 storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a
 favorite among the gods, one whoseideals andteachings
 they make their own. And a few people dedicate them
selves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest
 or champion of that god’s ideals.
 Your DMdetermineswhichgods, if any, are worshiped
 in his or her campaign. From among the gods available,
 you can choose a single deity for your character to serve,
 worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few
 that your character prays to most often. Or just make a
 mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM’s
 campaign so you can invoke their names when appro
priate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with the
 Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves
 or served, and consider the deity’s suggested domains
 when selecting your character’s domain.
 D&DPantheons
 EachworldintheD&Dmultiversehasitsownpantheons
 of deities, ranging in size from the teeming pantheons
 of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to the more fo
cused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. Many of
 the nonhuman races worship the same gods on differ
ent worlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by dwarves
 of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many other
 worlds.
 The Forgotten Realms
 Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared
 throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least
 thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and
 many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes,
 small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.
 The Life and Death Domains
 Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, partic
ularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection,
 childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter
 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric
 of any non-evil deity can choose it.
 A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the
 Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s
 Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs,
 but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dun
geon Master.
 Greyhawk
 The gods of Greyhawk come from at least four different
 pantheons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic
 groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the
 ages. As a result, there’s a great deal of overlap in their
 portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus
 is the Oeridian sun god, for example.
 Dragonlance
 The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven
 gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven
 of neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed
 by Takhisis and Sargonnas. These deities have been
 called by manydifferent namesandheldinvaryinglevels
 of esteem by different peoples and cultures through the
 world’s history, but they are the only gods of this world—
 their place fixed in the stars as constellations.
 Eberron
 The world of Eberron has many different religions, but
 the most important revolves around a pantheon called
 the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark
 Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have
 dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak
 with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primi
tive, bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting voice.
 Eberron’s other religions are very different from the tra
ditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church of
 the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the
 world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The
 philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies
 withinallmortalbeingsandreverestheundeadwhohave
 secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted
 to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron’s Un
derdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The follow
ers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading
 toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud
 this world will be transformed into light. And two related
 nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undy
ing Court, preservedasspiritsorevenundeadforms,and
 the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of an
cient wars.
 NonhumanDeities
 Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races
 are revered on many different worlds, though not always
 in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten
 Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.
 Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of their
 own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf gods in
clude Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and a num
ber of other gods thought to be their children and grand
children: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugmaren
 Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brigh
taxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and
 Vergadain. Individual Clans and kingdoms of dwarves
 mightreveresome,all, ornoneofthesedeities, andsome
 have other gods unknown (or known by other names) to
 outsiders.

Fantasy-Historical Pantheons
 The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are
 fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our
 world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most
 appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from their
 historical context in the real world and united into pan
theons that serve the needs of the game.
 The Celtic Pantheon
 It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every
 soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at
 night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the
 unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in this
 space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the
 brookandstream,theirmightheightenedbythestrength
 of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open
 moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the
 face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a
 brook, these gods forced themselves into being.
 TheCelticgodsareasoftenservedbydruidsasbycler
ics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature
 that druids revere.
 The GreekPantheon
 The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the
 gentlelapofwavesagainsttheshoresandthecrashofthe
 thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick
 boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides
 hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature
 echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for
 themselves inside the human heart, too.
 The Egyptian Pantheon
 Thesegodsareayoungdynastyofanancientdivine fam
ily, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the mainte
nance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental
 order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mor
tal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logi
cal and rightful place in the universe.
 TheEgyptianpantheonisunusualinhavingthreegods
 with the Death domain of different alignments. Anubis
 is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the
 souls of the dead. Set is a Chaotic evil god of murder,
 perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And
 Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. Thus,
 although most clerics of the Death domain (found in the
 Dungeon Master’s Guide) are villainous characters, cler
ics who serve Anubis or Nephthys need not be.
 The Norse Pantheon
 Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the
 icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the
 beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with
 every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, the
 homeof the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one
 that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have
 had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive,
 but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their
 environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and
 wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as
 they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors
 had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they
 see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the
 crash of thethunderandtheboomingoftheglaciers, and
 smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.
 The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the
 Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of
 fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two fami
lies arenowcloselyalliedagainsttheircommonenemies,
 the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like
 the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families some
times have overlap in their spheres of influence: Frey (of
 the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) are both associated
 with the sun, for example.

Appendix C: The Planes of Existence
 I
 ncredibly vast is the cosmos of the Dungeons &
 Dragons game, which teems with a multitude of
 worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions
 of reality, called the planes of existence. It en
compasses every world where Dungeon Masters
 runtheiradventures, allwithintherelativelymun
dane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are
 domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of
 pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and an
gels, and the dominions of the gods. Many spells and
 magic items can draw energy from these planes, sum
mon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with
 their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As
 your character achieves greater power and higher levels,
 you might undertake a quest to rescue a friend from the
 horrific depths of the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a
 tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard. You might
 walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on
 a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each
 dawn.
 The Material Plane
 The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophi
cal and elemental forces that define the other planes col
lide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane
 matter. All the worlds of D&D exist within the Material
 Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns
 and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in
 relation to the Material Plane.
 Theworlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse,
 for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs who
 settheirgamesthere,aswellastheplayerswhoseheroes
 adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert plan
ets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic
 combines with advanced technology and others trapped
 in anendlessStoneAge,worldswherethegodswalkand
 places they have abandoned.
 The best-known worlds in the multiverse are the ones
 that havebeenpublishedasofficialcampaignsettingsfor
 the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk, Blackmoor,
 Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Birthright,
 Dark Sun, and Eberron, among others. Each of these
 worlds boasts its own cast of heroic adventurers and
 scheming villains, its own ancient ruins and forgotten ar
tifacts, its own dungeonsanditsowndragons. Butifyour
 campaign takes place on one of these worlds, it belongs
 to your DM—youmightimagineit as one of thousands of
 parallel versions of the world, which might diverge wildly
 from the published version.
 Material Echoes
 TheMaterialPlaneisarichlymagicalplace,anditsmagi
cal nature is reflectedinthetwoplanesthatshareitscen
tral place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the Shad
owfell are parallel dimensions occupying the same cos
mological space, so they are often called echo planes or
 mirror planes to the Material Plane. The worlds and
 landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world of
 the Material Plane but reflect those features into differ
ent forms—more marvelous and magical in the Feywild,
 distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. Where a vol
cano stands in the Material Plane, a mountain topped
 with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire
 towers in the Feywild, and a jagged rock outcropping re
sembling a skull marks the spot on the Shadowfell.
 The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land
 of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with
 great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm
 of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the gen
tle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves and
 f
 ields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of the set
ting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never
 truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky and low
 in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the
 Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed bram
bles andsyrupyfens—perfectterritory for the Unseelie to
 hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those brought to
 the world byconjure woodlandbeingsandsimilar spells,
 dwell in the Feywild.
 The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is
 a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white
 where color has been leached from everything. It is a
 place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the sky
 is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.
 Beyond the Material
 Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of exis
tence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not sim
ply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed
 and governed by spiritual and elemental principles ab
stracted from the ordinary world.
 Planar Travel
 When adventurers travel into other planes of existence,
 they are undertaking a legendary journey across the
 thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where
 they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the
 stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking
 out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with
 an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and
 story for years to come.
 Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be
 accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using
 a planar portal.
 Spells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect ac
cess to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate
 can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of
 existence, with different degrees of precision. Ethere
alness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane
 and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—
 Positive and Negative Planes
 Like a domeabovetheotherplanes, the Positive Plane is the
 source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses
 all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark re
flection is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy
 that destroys the living and animates the undead.
 247
the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes.
 And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project
 themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer
 Planes.
 Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary
 interplanar connection that links a specific location on
 one plane to a specific location on another. Some por
tals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded
 passage, and simply stepping through it effects the in
terplanar travel. Others are locations—circles of stand
ing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole
 towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker
 from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices,
 typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar
 location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a vol
cano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the
 ocean (to the Plane of Water).
 Transitive Planes
 The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the
 Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms
 that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to
 another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projec
tion allow characters to enter these planes and traverse
 them to reach the planes beyond.
 The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension
 that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores,
 called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane
 and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those
 planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal
 Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethe
real, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant
 that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the
 Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly ef
fects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of
 force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a
 region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
 The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream,
 where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the
 planesofthedivineanddemonic. Itisagreat,silverysea,
 the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white
 and gray streaking among motes of light resembling dis
tant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair
 like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can
 be foundhere, but mostoftheAstral Plane is anendless,
 open domain.
 Inner Planes
 TheInnerPlanessurroundandenfoldtheMaterialPlane
 and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance
 from which all the worlds were made. The four Ele
mentalPlanes—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a ring
 around the Material Plane, suspended within the churn
ing Elemental Chaos.
 At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the
 Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographi
cal sense), thefourElementalPlanesresembleaworldin
 theMaterialPlane. Thefourelementsmingletogetheras
 they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky.
 Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental
 Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements
 exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth,
 blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These
 regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of
 Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the bor
derregion. AtthefarthestextentsoftheInnerPlanes,the
 pureelementsdissolveandbleedtogetherintoanunend
ing tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance,
 the Elemental Chaos.
 Outer Planes
 If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that
 makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the di
rection, thought and purpose for such construction. Ac
cordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine
 planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer
 Planes are best known as the homes of deities.
 When discussing anything to do with deities, the lan
guage used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual
 homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the
 idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and
 spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine
 the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of bor
der region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond
 ordinary sensory experience.
 Eveninthose perceptible regions, appearances can be
 deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hos
pitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But
 the landscape can change at the whims of the power
ful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of
 the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake
 them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding exis
tence itself to better fulfill their own needs.
 Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
 Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes of
ten seemquitesmall, buttheycanalsostretchontowhat
 seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided
 tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,
 in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or
 it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek
 across a single layer.
 The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of six
teen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (ex
cluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between
 them.

The planes with some element of good in their nature
 are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such
 as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes
 with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends
 suchasdemons,devils, andyugolothsdwellintheLower
 Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a char
acter whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s expe
riences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a
 good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in tune
 with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and
 more than a little uncomfortable.
 Other Planes
 Existing somehow between or beyond the known planes
 of existence are a variety of other realms.
 Sigil and the Outlands
 The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a
 plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness.
 Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it
 all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant
 and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain,
 with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting,
 shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world of
 the Material Plane.
 The Outlands is circular, like a great wheel—in fact,
 those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point
 to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the
 planes. That argument might be circular, however, for it
 is possible that the arrangementof theOutlandsinspired
 the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.
 Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,
 are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built
 around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each
 town shares many of the characteristics of the plane
 where its gate leads.
 At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the pla
nar wheel, the Spire shoots impossibly high into the sky.
 Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil,
 the City of Doors. This bustling planar metropolis holds
 countless portals to other planes and worlds.
 Sigil is a trader’s city. Goods, merchandise, and infor
mationcometoitfromacrosstheplanes. Thereisabrisk
 trade in information about the planes, in particular in the
 command words or items required for the operation of
 particular portals. These portal keys are highly sought
 after, and many travelers within the city are looking for a
 particular portal or a portal key to allow them to continue
 on their way.
 Demiplanes
 Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with
 their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that
 don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into
 being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells,
 such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a pow
erful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a
 fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the
 rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in
 power. A given demiplane can be entered through a sin
gle point where it touches another plane. Theoretically,
 aplaneshift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane,
 but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is
 extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reli
able, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.
 The Far Realm
 The Far Realm is beyond the known multiverse. In fact,
 it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own
 physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from
 the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter
 are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy ordi
nary geometry and biology.
 The entities that abide in the Far Realm are too alien
 for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic
 creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied with
 madness. Unspeakable things whisper awful truths to
 those whodarelisten. For mortals, knowledge of the Far
 Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude boundaries of
 matter, space, and eventually sanity.
 There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or
 at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once
 pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the
 Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak,
 but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the
 portal’s location—even its home world—is long-forgotten.
 Other portals might still exist, marked by the alien forces
 leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around
 them.

Appendix E: Inspirational Reading
 I
 nspiration for all of the fantasy work I have
 done stems directly from the love my father
 showedwhenIwasalad,forhespentmanyhours
 telling me stories he made up as he went along,
 tales of cloaked old men who could grant wishes,
 of magic rings and enchanted swords, or wicked
 sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen..
 .. All of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy when
 we are very young, from fairy tales such as those writ
ten by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang. This of
ten leads to reading books of mythology, paging through
 bestiaries, and consultation of copilations of the myths
 of various lands and peoples. Upons such a base I built
 myinterest in fantasy, being an avid reader of all science
 f
 iction and fantasy literature since 1950. The following
 authors were of particular inspiration to me.
